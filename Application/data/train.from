“People in therapy are often in therapy to deal with people in their life who won’t go to therapy”
In my first session, I told my therapist, "When parents don't go to therapy, their children have to."

Mine told me early on that family trauma trickles down from one generation to the next, until one person puts an end to it. Unfortunately for me that responsibility fell to me. At first it felt like waaaaay too much responsibility but now I’m grateful to myself for doing the work.

It's true but isn't it false at the same time? I go to therapy because of a**hole professors (who have crossed every mental boundary that exists on earth) but let's be real... this man has been in therapy for 20 years and it looks like it's amounting to nothing. Or perhaps him going to therapy is all false? Everything he says is false?  
Maybe it’s false or maybe it’s true, who knows. I’m sorry you’re in the situation because of someone like a prof. It’s mentally tolling and I have had to report a prof like that because he stepped over boundaries. But one thing I learned in therapy is that sometimes people who have gone or go to therapy are self centred which can happen with or without acknowledgement. They always think “my issues” “or my problems” so it’s always “me me me” so they can never apply their therapy and learning to other people and also think that “hey maybe other people are also going through this issue and I should be sympathetic and compassionate.” Could be a lot of other reasons to but this is the only one that I experienced and deemed to be true in that case. If it makes you feel better, remember profs are extremely temporary and should in no way hold any power or extensive stress over you. I’d report him if he’s mentally or emotionally stressing you to the point where you want to go to therapy. Definitely not cool, no person in that position should have that power. Also, destroy him on rate my prof lol  
I'm sorry it happened to you too. I've done my best reporting the man but the corruption in my school is heavy. As someone who was "friends" with most of these professors, chairs, deans, I knew how corrupt the system was. I just didn't know for 4 years that the idiot was abusing me all along -- a psychologist made me see the truth. These people have invaded every aspect of my life. It's no longer temporary as it is for most students. They know exactly who I talk to, what I talk about, who's in my life and they go to extreme lengths to insert themselves into my relationships. It's not even appropriate. The sad fact is that they're wealthy and of power even outside the school - it's like I'm fighting a battle skewed against me. Though I'm winning now, gosh I wish these a**holes don't even know who I am. I can't destroy him on ratemyprof -- he has every student blindly following him. My school is almost 100% low-income, first-generation students who statistically have troubles getting jobs. Just because this professor along with others are getting students jobs, these students are freaking following him like a cult. I can't count the number of students who got the job from him then ditched his ass after graduating. The shit thing is that because of therapy, I am so conscious of what's happening that I won't let myself go through this shit. If I were still the same me from the past, I'd suck it up, go through this as invisibly as possible, and say f*** you all to them. Sadly, that's not a possibility anymore because practically every professor knows who I am before I even begin the class.  But regardless :x you're right that therapy makes some people self-centered! Honestly, I somewhat don't even care about other human beings anymore unless I have reason to. I've noticed that people have always needed help more than I did, just that they're struggling in some way that made it seem like I was the problem.  
We had that happen at our school. Eventually so many students reported him he got fired. People know. There are people who see the truth of what's happening.

So true.  I’m in therapy because my dysfunctional parents and older sister won’t go to therapy because there is a stigma in Asian communities about seeing a therapist.  
I feel you on the stigma in asian communities BIG TIME

Anyone else feel like they wouldn’t need nearly as much therapy if their friends and family would go to therapy?
A thing a friend of mine likes to say: “People come to therapy because the people who need to go to therapy won’t go.”  
Anyone else feel like they wouldn’t need nearly as much therapy if their friends and family would go to therapy?
Yes, but you grow more by aiming for the place where you no longer need them to behave conditionally in order to feel good.

Indeed. Enabling this behavior doesn't help these folks, it just makes them worse. It's no different than giving money to an addict.

For some reason I will lash out at people for no reason and when we calm down I appologise. I have some mental illnesses but I never use them as an excuse and those of you who do are messed up, it's not cool to use mental illnesses as an excuse when you lash out. Forgive and forget don't make excuses.

Your mental illness is not an excuse to hurt others
This can go for any illness including Autism which this is an issue for us given we can get upset easily over little things.  A lot of us have communication issues and recently I got into a arguement over what my brother said to me about a game he was playing. He called me a backseat gamer and I feel that's a bit of an insult. I don't play a lot of the same games that I do so I may misunderstand things but that's not an excuse on his end to do what he did and he nearly messed up something dear to me. Instead, he tried to assault me and I pretty much took the fall for the whole thing since my mom sided with him. I still feel bad but I don't have money to seek help for all these issues which is why I'm filing disability to get some insurance to help me financially as well as on the health front so I don't get into debt trying to seek help sooner rather than later. PTSD is awful but still no excuse to abuse others and mistreat people period. There's help for you to get better where for us autistics, it's a life sentence of suffering that we have to deal with.

Man that sucks, but tbf this wasn’t really the right place to put it in. I really can’t say that its hate speech though but what do i know im just a teen 🤔  
Ah, sorry. That was under the wrong thread. This one did not get deleted.  Sorry ^  It is very much the right place, I would argue. I deleted my argument. I posted that in two places, sorry for the confusion. He, a teen, eh.  I wish you all the best! You are one smart teen!

Aaaamen. If we crumble and lash out here or there, we have to own up to it, explain ourselves and work on not repeating it.  It's one thing to struggle - it's another to just decide that a behaviorial pattern is okay. One of my mantras is "A reason is no justification." and mental illness being used as an excuse is actually how I came up with it. Sometimes when I get scared, I don't clam up but start yelling instead. It's a defense mechanism. It never occured to me to just decide that makes it okay - when it happens, I stop myself within two minutes max, apologize and focus on my healthier copes. It's a lot easier to empathize with people who are actually trying.  
Man, I love this. What I love to say as well. This is an explanation, not an excuse. Damn right it is.  Keep it up! Transform that pain! I root for you! Great job!  
Right back at you! What use is there in pain if we don't use it to create healing?

Your mental illness is not an excuse to hurt others
Would you know of any subreddits/groups I could join that encourage this?   I want to heal myself without enabling any bad behaviors.  
Oh, I deleted my first comment. I got confused a bit. Sorry!  So, apart from this one, I don't know really.  This is the only place, where I didn't get censored.  cPTSD just deleted me too, so I banned them. I cannot deal with enablers.  I will do my best not to turn like my abusers. And in my pain, I have hurt my allies in my past. Damn, I still have those dark impulses in me!!!  Never again! And I cannot deal with people who do not condemn this behavior in me, or in others.  I want my support network to condemn me too, if I step out of line. I get ya totally. Lashing out at allies is something not that far from me, too. This is what happens, when you are too busy thinking and forgiving your abuser.  You don't have any energy left for your allies and you lash out at them, instead of at the people that actually hurt you.  I will search, though! I will not give up in finding a support group!  
If you find one, please let me know.  A lot of the non emabling subreddits seem to be very small/somewhat dead -__-.   Like r/responsiblerecovery gets like 2 posts a month Yeah tho, cPTSD was great when I first found out about it.  However now it seems to be more about people who are stuck and who cannot get out of a victim role. I get how self compassion may be needed but there's a point where it becomes maladaptive.  
Indeed, nicely said. They have not made the leap to survivors. Condemning calling out child abuse hate speech and all that.  I know it. Fear of anger, fear of hate. I was there too. I was condemning anger once as well. I was condemning hate, as well.  One of the things that helped me was the one of my abusers. They told me I should not be angry, forgive them, and let go of hate, because it is bad for me. Sure, it was bad for me, while I was under their care, because any standing up for myself meant sever punishment. This is when it clicked, though. This is when I understood that anger and hate were shamed, because abusers wanted us submissive. And anger and hate are empowering. The slave is sad and submissive, not hateful and angry. I am a slave no more.  This is the difference between victims and survivors. The victims still believe their abusers.  Thank you for sharing this sub. :)  
Your mental illness is not an excuse to hurt others
I definitely have re-actional anger. I can call out bullshit and abuse a mile away and will hold my ground when confronted. My issue is that I have DID, and my blackouts are triggered by extreme stress and frustration. I would never intentionally harm someone because I was mad at them, but during a blackout I can get violent af. Chocking others, slamming them to the wall, grabbing them and yanking them around, I get dirty. I have been working really hard on walking away before I get too far, but when someone is intentionally attacking me it's instinct to react aggressively (especially if my calmer way of problem solving isn't getting through to them).  I know of someone who also has DID and a hairpin trigger. They will go into full tantrum mode; screaming and throwing things, making their "loved one" cowering on the couch while they are in their face screaming. The sad part is, this is ENCOURAGED in the household - they claim holding back on any emotion is unhealthy. Which is true, but there is a HEALTHY way of doing it that isn't going to harm others. From what I've heard the tantrums have lessened but they shouldn't have been tolerated to begin with, as one wrong move can set them back to square one or worse.  Your mental health is NOT an excuse to harm others, EVER.  
Your mental illness is not an excuse to hurt others
Totally agree. And actually you find a lot of these people go unchallenged they normalise and rationalise their awful behaviour and get a shock once someone tells them off (I've been that person to do so sometimes haha!)  
Tell me about it. I am banned from r/PTSD , r/cPTSD and r/raisedbynarcs  hahah

The world isn't black or white so take on your big boy pants and realize people can react in agressive ways against their own will. I can ensure you, no one with ptsd feels proud of strong or happy, after a trigger, leading to a flashback leading to 100% fight and flight reaction. You have any idea how much people with mental illnesses like PTSD already blame themselves for not being calmer better happier stronger more normal? That's why we need therapy, to hear a therapist say "Your illness isn't your fault, you did not choose it, and to have posttraumatic stress disorder is to be a victim of a response in your brain that is automatic" You sit on a forum reading about people who tries to vent out their fears and scars over this automatic reaction they never chose, and you think  YOU are a good person? You think we should salute you?  Let me ask you. Did you have a choice to not sit in a ptsd group to mock people and get likes on this post for your bullying? What is YOUR excuse?  To op and you other people, you have a choice to do something better with your mind and body then to be a reddit bully, if you have such low self esteem, I suggest you go to the therapy groups avd I'll gladly help you with your insecurities.  
You had me for a little bit, but to say that you hope someone gets traumatized is awful. You of all people should know that you have PTSD goddamnit.  I have been through trauma and I wouldn't wish it on anyone. Yes fight or flight reactions happen and yes, maybe OP doesn't understand them that well. But how dare you wish trauma on someone. I hope you stop being such an ass.  
You're right that was my overreaction for being sick tired of op and similar people judging others for being through shit that would have made them wanna kill themselves. My bad. I deleted it. Reality is, no one should go through what we had not even these immature ignorant people.  
I get that, but this is also a great example of what I think the post is about. Your comment was abusive, but instead of saying sorry. Now you redirect it to an overreaction and being tired.  Way too many people hide behind their disability instead of owning up to their mistakes.

When I asked the therapist for some water, she looked at me curiously and said "Does that have a special meaning to you, water?"
This is hilarious. I have to ask my therapist why he actually gives me a cup of water when I ask for one.  
When I asked the therapist for some water, she looked at me curiously and said "Does that have a special meaning to you, water?"
Maybe she thought water was a comfort item for you!? Like when you get overwhelmed you drink water and she was trying to figure that out?  Idk that’s so weird, but I’m giggling. I can’t even imagine how I would have reacted. Probably like, “idk clearly it has meaning to you, what does it mean for you?”  
therapist here! It is custom to always have a cup of water available and ready for clients. But, I have observed a pattern in certain clients who drink a lot of water during the session especially when they are overwhelmed. I will sometimes challenge that, much much later in the therapy process to see if drinking water is being used to dissociate from the feeling in that moment (this is why we don't generally allow eating, smoking or coffee/tea drinking in session). edit: I am now realising my own therapist never has a cup of water for me in the room. I always have a water bottle on me, so I only realised this now after reflecting on your post. Strange.  
So my therapist probably would hate if I smoked my vape during session? Jk. I’d never do that 😂 That’s good insight! And interesting.

I was just thinking how strange ut is that people bring water bottles and actually find the time to drink during session. Then i realized I always bring a cup of coffee, and it's a great excuse to shut up for a minute

Oh wow, I’m in therapy for my dissociation and I pretty much drink half a bottle every session...

Wow, I wonder what it would be like if you mindfully didn’t reach for your bottle till the end of the session, or maybe didn’t take it at all.

LOL You handled it nicely. I have a tendency to be curt so I would have said “the F is that supposed to mean?”  
Should've said that instead. Then I'd have some more clarity now.

Well I'm not sure whether I should. This was really the only strange thing during the session, the rest was fine. But, it was really weird.   If I see her again, I'll follow up!

My second therapist’s office had a policy that a glass of water awaits the client in the office (I saw them briefly for 4 or 5 sessions) which I got used to.  So when I started seeing my current therapist I was dissapointed by the lack of water. At some point we discussed how I would appreciate water there, which prompted me to share a story from my childhood where as a little kid, I would nightly ask my parent for a glass of water before they turned off the light in my room for sleep. I don’t think it was due to thirst. I think I wanted to postpone going to sleep. And also somewhere in me it was a reassurance they care about me. At least a little bit. So my therapist getting water for me is a mark of care I guess on some level. On a bad day I sometimes wonder if it’s a bother getting water for me.  We also had a conversation about the box of tissues at some point. She would usually pull them out when I started crying. And I told her I prefered having them at the table from the start.

A good reminder for myself to keep carrying my own water to session! Ha. I really needed a laugh today, and this did it! Sorry, not laughing at the situation or the analysis of it, but just the “wtf” moment you must have had.  Like, I’m thirsty? My mouth is dry? (Unless, of course, you DO have some greater meaning behind water. If that’s the case, I too am suddenly curious! 😉)  
When I asked the therapist for some water, she looked at me curiously and said "Does that have a special meaning to you, water?"
Oh my!! I think she forgot to give you water! I would actually just bring water next time and make a comment about it -- like I brought my own water this time since I was so thirsty all session last week. :P

Oh god this is hilarious. She is a complete caricature of a therapist, overanalysing ever move you make. I can’t believe you had to spend the whole session dry mouthed and thirsty!  
When I asked the therapist for some water, she looked at me curiously and said "Does that have a special meaning to you, water?"
I actually use drinking water as a coping mechanism when I am really emotional so this makes sense to me.  I tend to bring a cup of tea with me to sessions I know will be intense because the act of stopping and drinking something brings my emotions down and helps regulate them. I’ve done this since I was a teenager and I make sure my therapists know this is a self regulating coping mechanism.

Ha ha the same happened to me. I asked her to speak louder and she said "Is the problem really my volume?" - I was so confused

I once asked my therapist for a glass of water (once in like 1,5 years). She got up and got it for me, no big deal. The next time, she was talking about how I ask from people to take care of me when it's not needed, and what was her example? The freagin' water.

This was a laugh I needed!! I hope you are able to build a relationship with this therapist and maybe one day be able to joke about ~that one time~ with the water lol  
When I asked the therapist for some water, she looked at me curiously and said "Does that have a special meaning to you, water?"
Y'all are putting too much thought into being thirsty. You are talking excessively and with emotion. Of course you're thirsty. Therapists taking it as anything else is just....odd...

That therapist just crazy, did she gave you the water?  
Nope haha  
That's just evil. Seriously unless you feel really good with her from now on, I'd look for someone else. She doesn't sounds professional. I was always offered water  
pipe down dude

I agree that it's weird. It's too funny though. I'm searching for a therapist and I feel like I'm just gonna break down crying. I've been holding it in for almost 7 months and only talked to a relationship coach recently. He validated my feelings but I don't like how he said that we shouldn't be anyone's priority. I guess he meant that we shouldn't rely on anyone or put our whole life into them.  
I don’t think it’s ok he said that. You go to therapy because you can’t cope with your own problems yourself anymore. Isn’t that kind of the point? Sorry you had that experience!

That is the weirdest thing I’ve ever heard of. I don’t know if I could go back to her if she did that to me. I would wonder if we were speaking the same language or even if we were from the same planet. It’s so disorienting to ask for water and not have the person understand you even when you are both speaking the same language.  Your therapist should get what you are saying and it sounds like this woman did not get you at all.  
Yeah, I felt like I’m in the wrong movie or sth. Still debating with myself whether I should go back or not. Unfortunately she’s pretty much the only therapist I could find that has a spot available now.

LOL that's a little funny haha. I'd just ask her during your next session! Some therapists, because they are human, are a little weird tho so if you notice other stuff or if more esoteric tendencies reveal itself you might reconsider your choice of therapist (unless you like that).  
So you’d say that this behaviour goes into the direction of esoterica? Cause that’s really not at all my thing. I’ll have a lookout for it in the next session

I dont know about other people, but I use water when I'm about to cry. I personally hate crying, so I tend to use me drinking my water bottle as an excuse to take a breather. This might sound weird but she might have wanted you to be uncomfortable, not in a malicious way, but in a therapeutic way. When you're not allowed to take those pauses and regain your composure, you're true feelings and emotions might emerge.  I really dont know her intentions, but just a thought

This sounds like she was utilising techniques that can induce a light trance and she was concerned that if she gave you water it would break this. By deliberately misinterpreting your request she hoped to take your mind off the stressed state of your sympathetic nervous system so that she could continue the session. Or perhaps she was testing the strength of the hypnotic state.  
That’s odd though, cause she didn’t say or do anything in the first 10 minutes when I was talking (up until the water question). Not sure how she’d put me into a trance. Also, wouldn’t that be kind of unethical since I didn’t sign up for a hypnosis?

She sounds like a typical psychodynamic/ psychoanalytic therapist. This is what they do, you were not being put in a trance  
Yeah she is a psychoanalytic therapist. So thats normal for this therapy style?

Was there a possibility to have water? I mean could you see the water and why did not you just get up and get it? I am just curious if water was available. It is not usual thing that therapist provide water.

Not to take away from your positive experience but "sassy black personality"? I'm not African American, just African, so maybe this is nothing to get offended at but I feel like it's the equivalent of saying "redneck country bumpkin personality" to a white person (granted I don't know your race so...).  
I'm mixed. It's just a stereotypical way some black women laugh. Not meant to be offensive. Just a description.  
Agree. I have to say I absolutely love how “real” women (or people for that matter, but thinking about women) can be. Say what’s really going on and with such open authentic expression. I have such respect for strong women who can just let it all hang out so to speak. Even as a therapist, with mindful consideration, still be expressive in this way that lightens the situation. I’m as white as they come and I think women who have a history of overcoming oppression are generally so dang strong and have gained a license to speak and be so very free. I absolutely love those personalities however they got there. Way too many women are so precautionary and reserved.

I'd like to believe I'm pretty tuned in to black American culture (it's everywhere) and yet I'm having a hard time imagining the stereotype you're referring to. I've met quite a few black Americans and I wouldn't describe them as sassy. I'm trying to think of black actresses and roles they've played and the characters are so diverse I can't even pick out which one of the many is a stereotypical sassy black laugh. And I'm being so serious right now. Which one? And I feel like if I have to ask then maaayyybe it's an offensive generalisation you've just made.

Ya know, it's kinda shitty how you've picked out one simple thing that wasn't meant to be offensive, blew it up out of proportion, and are going on a rant about it. It totally missed the whole point of me sharing this story about my therapy session. If you don't like something someone said on the internet, it is very easy to just scroll past it and let people be.

Of course they want to know. They want you to talk. You don’t have to carry your burden alone. You will meet new people who will be better friends and help you. Your not alone on your journey. You are stronger than the negative thoughts. You are strong for reaching out for help. Things will change when you least expect it.

Please hold on At your age I was going through the worst psychological pain, result of lots of ptsd that was starting to manifest as bpd.  Shitty parents shitty sibling shitty friends shitty teachers bullies abusive partner etc. I was lucky to have a therapist, though. And I’m SO grateful I didn’t kill myself.  It’s never been as bad as when I was 15-16.  So hold on, I promise it will be better  
I want to echo this. I also had suicidal ideation at your age and i'm really glad that i got to experience everything i've been able to. I've gone through a lot of really negative things as an adult too, but the moments of joy, of learning new things, understanding more about why I was depressed, made life way better. I have another friend from high school who also had a lot of suicidal ideation as well. Now is super stable and happy, and one of the more solid humans I know.  In high school, you're stuck in a "box", so to speak. This may change quickly as the years go on. Or they may not., but after high school you have a lot more autonomy as to who you make friends with and who you focus in on. "Do these people I hang with help me? Are they contributing to my well being?" You can ask those questions later in life. You can ask those questions now and get ahead of things! You can learn to understand that you deserve those things 100% One more point, I'm 39 years old and just started seeing a therapist in 2018. I'm seeing a cognitive behavioral therapist and I've found it to be extremely helpful. Got me through one of the most difficult years of my life and taught me how to continue moving forward. This is after decades of severe depression. I survived a psych ward visit and many other things, but honestly, I feel way better now.  Just know that there is so much out there. The amount of knowledge you have now may be dwarfed by the amount of knowledge you may have in a few years or maybe more, maybe less. Remember, if all the negative stuff counts, all the positive stuff does too. Don't beat yourself up, or learn not to. Forgive yourself for backslides. Making mistakes is a part of learning. We're all a work in progress and if people don't recognize that, it's their problem, not yours.

My sister committed suicide two weeks ago. Please don’t put your family through what I am going through. I wasn’t even that close with my sister. We rarely talked, we hadn’t sat down and talked in person in probably ten years. We were on good terms, but we just had our own lives and didn’t talk much. So you might think, well, you weren’t that close so it shouldn’t hurt that much. Right?  I feel like I am drowning. I often just sit and stare at the wall for hours at a time, completely lost. I’m not eating. I’ve lost ten pounds in two weeks. I’m not sleeping. I slept about three hours last night.  It’s like someone threw me into the middle of the ocean with an anchor tied around my neck.  Suicide is permanent.  I watched an interview a while ago with a guy who attempted suicide by jumping off a bridge. He said that as soon as he jumped, he immediately regretted it. In the few seconds as he fell, unable to stop himself, he wished he had never jumped. He thought to himself, “No one will ever know.” He lived, and he has talked to hundreds of other people who have attempted suicide. He said every single person he talked to who had attempted suicide by jumping off bridge all said the same thing, “As soon as I jumped, I wished I could take it back.” I can’t tell you how horrible my life has been these past two weeks. Even people who barely knew her are hurting and crying. Her roommate who found her is a complete mess. They were good friends and spent a lot of time together. I know what it’s like to be depressed. I know that it sucks, and it’s awful, and it feels like things will never change. I’ve suffered from really bad clinical depression since I was about 12 years old. I’m 27 now, and I’ve found ways to live with it. I’m married, I have two beautiful daughters, and a wife who I love with all my heart. I contemplated suicide myself as a teenager. But again, it’s permanent. If I had gone through with it, I would have missed so many joys, so much goodness that has happened in my life, despite my struggles. Please don’t. You have no idea how much it hurts to lose someone to suicide. It didn’t even hurt this much when my dad left our family. It didn’t hurt this much when one of my best friends passed away unexpectedly from a heart attack. Suicide is different, and the pain is unimaginable. Please don’t.

i don’t think they would want to know that their child is depressed and fucked up I am 100% positive that your family would love to know what’s going on, and would also love the opportunity to help you through this time. I’m saying this as a person watching their loved one battle a similar situation. Depression is a bitch, and it can swallow a person whole, but there’s help out there. Please reach out to your family and let them know what you’re going through. They will help you. You can, and will, overcome this.  
I know you’re just trying to help, but it’s very possible that OP’s family is extremely abusive, and they just don’t know it yet. It wasn’t until I’d begun suffering from serious mental health issues that I began to see who really cared about me and who just wanted me around for their own personal benefit.  
If this is the case, is there a good friend or trusted adult you could talk to? In an ideal world, no one would be stuck in a position where this would be case. Unfortunately, our world is far from ideal. Even if it’s not in person, try to call or Skype with someone else that you can trust.  Due to some issues I’ve had with my family in the past, I’m not completely comfortable talking to them about everything I’ve felt/been feeling either. At some of my lowest points, it has really helped to talk to someone outside of my family. In high school, those people were my music teacher and my best friend. In college, they were my applied lessons teacher (I majored in music) and a couple of friends I made in the music department. Recently, they were some coworkers that I’ve spent the last few years with and have gotten to know well.  Please know that you are not alone. Life can really suck and be unbearable, but it can and will get better with time.

How can you say for sure you don’t need this? Have you tried reaching out for therapy or medicine? Does your parents or family know of your pain?

Hey! So, please don't. The question is not "Am I happy?" or "Have I ever been happy/" It's not even "Will I be happy?" Happiness is a place we visit, usually at random, for a brief time. The visits are longer and more frequent when we have meaning in our life. Meaning we create. My life at age 15 was school, home (not great), some friends (we mainly bonded over how shitty everything was), weed and alcohol. Not exactly a rich, fulfilled life. There is potential for your experience to change. In fact, I guarantee that your life will be different in a year, a month, a day. How it will be different no one can say, but it will not be the same. HIGH SCHOOL SUUUUUUUCKS!!!!! I would not go back for a million dollars; not kidding. And I am not rich. It has no relation to the rest of your life (I'm 51). Think of it as a test of endurance, if you can get through even the next six months with the depression you have, then you can repeat that until graduation. Then, enduring whatever pain you have will be easier, and it may also be less pain to endure. I am a psychologist who works with people your age, and I can continue this conversation in detail if you like (here or privately), but I promise there are ways to decrease your suffering and increase meaning in your life, today.

Ayy man, trust me, I know exactly what your going through, I’m not gonna sit here and say everything is gonna be okay and be all cliché. I’m 19 and I’ve had depression since 16 in high school, and just last night just like you I had those voices in my head running wild out of my control. I don’t have a solution or cure for depression. But I know sure as hell that this isn’t the one. You have too many great memories around the corner. Happiness will come your way I promise. I keep battling my demons as long as you do.  
Thanks bro, good luck  
I’m here for you bro, your not alone ✊🏽

Hi! Do you want help?

Ok. It sounds like you are depressed. (Sorry if that is a ridiculous understatement.) How are your current circumstances? Are you safe, sheltered and fed? I just want to get the basics out of the way.

Dawg, imma just summarise what I want to say to you with this: "Just hang on", seriously. May sound stereotypical or something but really I'm not a professional at this kind of situation but just hang on. Ain't there shit you want to do with your life? Be it something big like make yourself rich and famous or even something small like go to Japan or get your own car. Simple goals like those are the types of things that you need to keep in mind because all those experiences you would have? Gone. All of its gone cos your pain at the moment is too much for you to bare and you want it to stop. Your friends and family all wish that you achieve those dreams and if you just worked up the courage to tell them, to explain to them your problems I'm fucking positive they'll help, if they truly love you they will. I really didn't want to make something too long but I can't just summarise the different aspects of life that'll just be gone from your grasp cos you decide to end it all, to stop writing and give up halfway through the book that is your life. I'm not gonna say these feelings are due to teen hormones or something cos although that may be the case I'm not a professional of any form and can't give you that idea unless that's what I believe to be true but what I do know is that there are people out there who want you to be happy, be it your family, friends, teachers or even the dipshits who've commented on your Reddit posts, trying to talk you down because when it comes down to it the majority of Humans all care about eachother and want the best for eachother. That includes you, we all want you to be happy and I'm sure if just you telling us your story has made us go out of our way to help you then I'm damn sure that if you just reach out to the people you know they will help you shoulder the burden or solve your problems because they want you to be happy as I and all the other people here do. Edit: one last note, if you can't work up the courage to tell family members of your situation then just message your mum or dad links to your Reddit post, as whilst it may be a bit I dunno... Insincere I guess is the word it's a lot easier than typing out a whole thing or even worse, speaking directly to them because goddamn do I know how hard it can be to open up to others but I'm sure ctrl c and ctrl v is a lot shorter to do and as such is less of a time to back out of it because you need to seek out others for help because suicide is never the way out.  
Honestly you kinda inspired me man, thank you

As the mother of a child who completed suicide I can honestly from the bottom of my heart tell you that your loved ones would rather deal with a fucked up depressed child (as you say) than a dead one. Reach out and take the hands that want to help you. We are all fucked up. That is what makes life entertaining. I have always said normal is just a term someone came up with to make everyone else feel bad about themselves.  If you are that sad please have yourself committed to a psychiatric hospital. There is NOTHING wrong with helping yourself get to a better place again. If medication is what makes you feel okay in this world then take it!  I personally feel that everyone could use a little something. When people tell me I’m crazy I tell them the only difference between us is I have been diagnosed and they are undiagnosed.  I would not be here if it was not for extremely high does of antidepressants. I was put on them after I lost my son and I will be on them for the rest of my life because they help keep my mind focused on all the things I still have to do in this world before I can leave.  Please just think about how important you are and how dark and terrible the world will continue to become if we keep losing beautiful people to Suicide.  Find what works for you to get your smile back. I promise there is something out there even when you feel like nothing will work.  I know this because I have lived it.  
Honestly this is amazing, thank you. i am so sorry for your loss

You are not alone. We all care about you. Your family and friends care about you. You deserve to find happiness! The only way that can happen is if you stay. I know it might seem impossible that you can get better, but trust me, you can! I survived a suicide attempt a few years ago, and I'm glad that I survived. Things got better. I learned how to handle things in a healthier way and got the help I needed. I used to not want help because I thought it was a waste of time. It wasn't! Therapy and/or other treatments could help you too!  Please stay and see how much better it can be once you start getting help. If you don't feel comfortable telling your family, any doctor or teacher can also provide you with resources to help!  You are so strong, you've made it this far! Please keep living. 💜 You are loved, and deserve a chance to get better and be happy. Just because you are experiencing this doesn't mean that you're the problem, it's not you!! You aren't fucked up. It isn't your fault. It requires attention and treatment just like any physical wound. You are important, and so is your mental health! It may help right now to make a list of the little things in life that you find beautiful; anything that makes you laugh; and people, places, and things that you like being around. Keep going over those things in your mind and try to use them as reasons to stay, at least until you have access to treatment! 💜

I am happy to see you are here, and thank you for posting an update. Your first post was honestly weighing heavily on my mind today. There is some great advice on this thread. Just please, open up to someone you trust and tell them how you are really feeling. See a therapist. You are important and so is your mental health. Two years is a long time to be doing this on your own. I get why you are frustrated and over it! But you really don’t have to do this alone. You can get through this! I hope to see an update saying things have gotten better for you.

I just need someone to hug and to listen to me and cry to. Someone who knows what the pain is like. I want to end it. I want the pain, the voices, the loneliness to end. I can’t take it anymore. It’s driving me insane. I can’t...I’m desperate. Please help me. Please help me see past my pain. I need you. It hurts so much. I didn’t ask for this. I need to be able to sleep, to eat, to feel happy. I’ve never felt happy. It’s only pain. Endless and unimaginable pain.

UPDATE: i am going to kill myself today
please consider that at 15 your hormones play a lot of tricks on you. Everything can feel really intense and permanent. It's not. Why not give yourself time to see what post-adolescent you feels like?  I've recently gone through this with a kid your age. It was absolute hell for a while there but he agreed to give it a chance. 1 ½ years later he's doing so much better and while he's still working on social anxiety he's really far from the suicidal thoughts he was stuck in. He's like a different person.  Please take some time and read about the effect that hormones have on your body and your mind. It's like having mosquito bites when you're sunburned. That shit feels like hell on earth and it's all you can think about but once it's gone it seems like it was a million years ago. The intensity will end and then you will be able to handle the things we all do. Will you give it a shot?  
Thanks n all, but i hate when y'all say "hormones". Depression is a fucking disease, plus hormones for two years without a break!?

I have a friend whi I met after an overdose in a program - she cried every single day in the program but I learned she is much like me and does not cry around other people. She brings them up and gives smiles and hugs and love. She makes me smile with her positive smile and and be happy posts. I have seen that girl on her knees begging to die. I don't care if that is what she has to do all day... post that shit all she wants, I an going to frown if I want to.

Cognitive psychologists believe that depression and anxiety are a result of a cycle of negative self-talk and a negative view of the world. If that's true, then being positive in as many ways as you can can only be beneficial. It not as easy as turning a switch on like these people suggest but it is the very bottom line of cognitive behavior therapy.  
Therapist here. It's a lot more complicated than that. Also there are a lot of other types of therapies out there (like humanistic) therapies that take a different approach. Personally, as a therapist, I find that avoidance of negative emotions is one of the biggest issues clients have. Ironically, it's what gets people stuck in the negative cycles.

Great post! Just want to add, therapists are legally obligated to report elder (65+) abuse, as well.  
+As well as child abuse  
But not if there's no current danger.  Like if you are an adult and report being abused as a child, the therapist should ask if you want to report.  But is not obligated to make a report.   Also "duty to warn" if you make a credible threat toward another person, that you intend to hurt/kill them.

Thank you for this, I’ve been trying to get a new therapist and have definitely been having suicidal thoughts recently.  
So far the best therapist I have ever had is my college counselor. At our first appointment she asked about my experience with therapist's and I told her all the things that I hate and right there in the room she made a vocal and thought out plan to avoid the things I hate. So now she gets all the information I tell her, remembers details from our last conversations, she asks questions to get more details and that's it. She doesn't give advice about something unless I ask for it, she doesn't offer any judgment unless I tell her my side and when she does offer judgement it's always just validation of my point. And she's free through my school so I can tell that she doesn't care about what I could give her money wise-she doesn't benefit from having more appointments. She just cares about helping me get better  
I’ve been talking to my school counselor when I can. I don’t know how different it is because I’m in highschool and not college but my counselor has been more busy recently  and has to deal with a bunch of other students.

How severe would it have to be to get sent to the mental hospital?  
I was initially going to post this but wasn't sure if it's industry standard but from my experience, I didn't even have severe suicidal thoughts but my therapist said I can't see her anymore, please go to a hospital/psychiatric ward.  All I said was that I have thoughts of not wanting to live anymore but I don't think of ANY plans of going through with it. Moreover, I specifically said that I have control over these suicidal thoughts and can reverse them right away. She thought about what I said over a week and at the next session, she told me to not see her anymore -- please get help from a hospital, psychiatric ward, or a psychologist. Maybe it's a one-off event but that's partially why I don't mention my suicidal thoughts, however brief, to therapists anymore. I know mine last maybe 1 minute 1 time a month, and I can stop it! but my therapists might not understand it's not that severe for me. Like, I have gone through enough depression that right now, I don't even want to give up no matter how hard things get. Even if I am wildly depressed one day, I just go to bed knowing I'll feel better in the morning and try again. I'm desperate to live life on the other side, and so even if something triggers a suicidal thought, I have control over it. I wish my therapists understood that. But I get that if any therapist hears of suicidal thoughts, they might just suggest mental hospitals or emergency care right away. They don't know what to do to help you besides sending you to professional medical care.  
Oh no I’m so sorry for your experience.  I feel frustrated that your therapist not only didn’t help, but shoved you off to other resources. I promise you that what you experienced is not the norm.  There will be other therapists who can understand it and take you seriously.  People who are trained in suicidality know that it’s a spectrum, and you’ve clearly got that inner resource to ‘reverse’ your thoughts which is not an easy thing to do!  
It's not the norm?! Oh man, that therapist seriously convinced me that it was the norm :x I felt bad for even bringing it up because I was paying to see her and it was our first 2 sessions... and it was hard for me to even find a suitable therapist!  Thanks for this! I thought it was a standard procedure to shove me away or something.

Oh cause I'm scared to go there. I've hidden many things from the counselor at my school just so I don't have to go to that place. Where I live the hospital is in bad shape and I hear many horror stories.  
Ohhh I'm assuming it's high school counselor? I'm in college so I'm not sure how it works for high school but because the students are under 18, whatever the counselor says really might be more powerful than your decision. Maybe someone else will know this better than I do :x If you voice suicidal thoughts to a school counselor, I'm assuming the counselor reaches out to your parents first and will potentially suggest further medical care like a mental hospital :o oh man :x those places can be more scarring than helpful. My friend told me about how she walked herself into the ER before and she had a relatively OK experience but then there are definitely places that are traumatizing D:  I'm hoping things get better for you!!!  
How severe would it have to be to get sent to the mental hospital?  
If you say you have a plan - you’ll be put on at least a 72 hold... and it’s not fun and you don’t learn anything - they basically babysit you and some other very mentally unstable people. I’ve been in a psych ward and jail & I much rather go to jail.

Things you should know when talking to a therapist about suicide
My mother was a narcissist. I cut contact four years ago. Today I was told she's dead.
A couple of months ago my aunt tried contacting my partner and dumped a bunch of info about relatives dying off or getting sicker, as well as other people having kids and uploading video of all of that. I deleted my facebook a couple of years ago as well to cut complete contact but they still try to contact me through my boyfriend's facebook every so often. He read the messages for me, watched the videos and summarized it all for me, then we blocked her without responding.  The sad thing that I've learned the hard way is that it could be both a trap and a real situation at the same time. In many dysfunctional/abusive/pathological families, some members of that group only feel power or control when they manipulate it from other members and they will use any leverage they can get away with to accomplish this, even illness and death. This is the maladaptive coping mechanism that they are entitled to and nothing is likely going to change that in most situations.  If those who abused you are too corrosive on you, where even a brief encounter leaves you wounded and ill, them having cancer or them dying does not give them permission to erode your life any further, especially if you have other loved ones in your life that you need to look out for.  The worst of it is that if it is bad enough, you have to cut away other people too who allow your abuser to influence you in a debilitating way. It is horrible to go through this and I am so sorry you are suffering with this too, but for your health and sanity you need to protect yourself regardless of your mother's health or departure from life.  I had wondered too how it would affect me if my mother had passed away. If I had stayed in any amount of contact with her I'd be filled with malice and resentment, it would warp me into someone I don't want to become. If she died now, I'd have my own meditative funeral on my own terms and I'd still not contact anyone and I would not be involved with the funeral whatsoever.  However, I'd wish her peace, I'd wish her the peace she never gave herself in life. I would wish her the peace and autonomy she desperately needed deep down, I would mourn the person she could have been had she made healthier choices for herself in life, then I'd have a lovely meal with my partner and count the blessings in my life. I'd literally count the blessings by making a gratitude list, I've written something like 6000 things I've felt grateful for having or not having over these 6 years. I hope this helps you too, don't give up the beauty in your life right now for those who cut you the deepest, no matter what. You fought hard to have what you have now, don't give them the power to topple that over.  
This was an absolutely wonderful response. I feel validated and understood. Thank you.  My boyfriend also deleted his Facebook when this started,  he said he never used it anyway, and he blocked my mother's number a long time ago.  
I am happy I could give you that much, this is hard, it is a very difficult thing that isn't so well understood and I am happy that I could give you that. This group really has helped me recently, I hope it helps you too if you are not already in it: r/EstrangedAdultChild  
I feel like most people think I'm lying or crazy when I try to explain the situation. I haven't been validated by anyone but my boyfriend.

Awesome reply.  
A couple of months ago my aunt tried contacting my partner and dumped a bunch of info about relatives dying off or getting sicker, as well as other people having kids and uploading video of all of that. I deleted my facebook a couple of years ago as well to cut complete contact but they still try to contact me through my boyfriend's facebook every so often. He read the messages for me, watched the videos and summarized it all for me, then we blocked her without responding.  The sad thing that I've learned the hard way is that it could be both a trap and a real situation at the same time. In many dysfunctional/abusive/pathological families, some members of that group only feel power or control when they manipulate it from other members and they will use any leverage they can get away with to accomplish this, even illness and death. This is the maladaptive coping mechanism that they are entitled to and nothing is likely going to change that in most situations.  If those who abused you are too corrosive on you, where even a brief encounter leaves you wounded and ill, them having cancer or them dying does not give them permission to erode your life any further, especially if you have other loved ones in your life that you need to look out for.  The worst of it is that if it is bad enough, you have to cut away other people too who allow your abuser to influence you in a debilitating way. It is horrible to go through this and I am so sorry you are suffering with this too, but for your health and sanity you need to protect yourself regardless of your mother's health or departure from life.  I had wondered too how it would affect me if my mother had passed away. If I had stayed in any amount of contact with her I'd be filled with malice and resentment, it would warp me into someone I don't want to become. If she died now, I'd have my own meditative funeral on my own terms and I'd still not contact anyone and I would not be involved with the funeral whatsoever.  However, I'd wish her peace, I'd wish her the peace she never gave herself in life. I would wish her the peace and autonomy she desperately needed deep down, I would mourn the person she could have been had she made healthier choices for herself in life, then I'd have a lovely meal with my partner and count the blessings in my life. I'd literally count the blessings by making a gratitude list, I've written something like 6000 things I've felt grateful for having or not having over these 6 years.

Great response!  
My mother was a narcissist. I cut contact four years ago. Today I was told she's dead.

Why does it matter if she's dead or not? She's dead to you either way. Fuck her. Also, check out r/RaisedByNarcissists  
This made me laugh and I dunno why

This is exactly what I was trying to find a gentler way to say. Blunt is typically not my style when it comes to these types of things but I appreciate the ability. I was going to recommend a pro and con list because they have helped me a lot. But if OP’s mom is like those on r/RaisedByNarcissists (a sub I recommend too) then imo it’s not worth the risk. And, really, what is to be gained by contacting the people you previously decided to cut out of your life?

Are you still in contact with your sister? If so, text her to find out whether it’s real or not

It’s okay to have all these feelings resurfacing. She’s inflicted trauma on you, so it’s all stored in your subconscious still. But you do NOT owe her anything, or need to open lines of communication just because she may or may not be sick or dead. I would definitely recommend a good trauma informed therapist (not all therapists are created equal, you might have to search a while to find one that clicks with you), so that you can heal from the wounds she caused you. Because otherwise those wounds will still be with you and still come out sideways in different types of ways. And you don’t want her to have that power over you. You deserve to be free of the pain she caused you!!

Is your sister typically an enabler/FM? You know whether to trust her or not. That’s next level though and I’m sorry you’re going through such BS  
Yes. She encouraged my mother to "let me fall on my ass" after my dad died and I was struggling with surviving, heading towards the worst depression in my life. Their main concern was that I wouldn't look for a second job to make more money.  
Then i would say dont listen to it and also block your sis. Just my personal opinion, knowing how siblings can be just as bad if not worse than NParent when helping them  
Shes been blocked. She messaged my friends.

I’m sorry you’re going through this. It must be awful. I also have a narcissist mother so I can relate to that side but this is awful regardless of the the outcome.  
I feel so like.. lost. I'm almost... relieved?

What value did your mother bring to your relationship? Likely little to none. It was likely all about her. It’s ok for you to remove toxic relationships form your life.  It’s also ok to feel relieved.  
I feel so like.. lost. I'm almost... relieved?  
I’m still in contact with both my narc parents. I imagine when they die, it will feel incredibly confusing. I do love them, despite them being the most manipulative, emotionally stunted people I know. Relief will undoubtably be part of it. They’re currently trying to coerce me into moving out of my apartment in NYC In the middle of a pandemic, while I am staying out of state and have no car. At least this is the wake up call I needed to become financially independent. I’m done with them using money to control me, particularly when it goes against all reason.  Don’t feel bad for feeling positive emotions about this. Narcs know how to bleed us dry emotionally. I haven’t been able to eat all week, adopted kittens yesterday, and all they care about is money they don’t even need. We’ve never done anything to deserve this shit.  
My mother was a narcissist. I cut contact four years ago. Today I was told she's dead.
There are 2 possibilities here.  1) It's true.  2) It's not, and your sister and mom are just trying to guilt you into responding, since just simply saying she had cancer didn't work. Honestly, I would grieve as though #1 was true, regardless. Even if she's not and is just fishing for a response, she would be dead to me anyway. Grieve the mother you didn't but SHOULD have had. It's okay to have big, conflicting feelings regarding the death of someone who caused you so much pain. You're not a terrible person for feeling relieved. You're not weak. These feelings don't mean you regret going no contact with her. Be gentle with yourself. I'm glad you have a therapy appointment. It should help you work through these feelings. Hang in there, OP. 💗

I’m a psychologist and one of the analogies I use with anxiety is that, when teaching the brain to stay out of those anxious ruts, it’s like driving a stick shift - you have to understand how things work, when to change gears, and how not to roll backwards when things get challenging. If you practice though, eventually the new road become the rut and, most of the time, you’ll be driving an automatic on cruise control. You’re still driving but it’s much easier and requires far less thought.  Keep up the practice!

Avoiding anxiety only creates more anxiety :( Only way is to accept it If you try to avoid something, you're training your brain to have stronger emotional reactions to the something. It's very counter intuitive  
I don’t see where I recommended avoiding anxiety?  
'when teaching the brain to stay out of those anxious ruts' ?

I am not a therapist. However, I am here to tell you there is hope. Mostly reformed negative nancy here. I say mostly reformed because I still have to manage my anxiety. It isn't gone, but it is a hell of a lot easier to deal with now and happens much less frequently. I also have tools to soothe anxiety. I've learned how to put it down or allow anxiety to fuel me into action. I don't want anxiety gone, because it can be an alert to something that needs my attention. I just don't want it to overwhelm me, suck any enjoyment I have out of life, or paralyze me (mentally, emotionally, etc).  What you are doing now is retraining your brain and attempting to change your go to thoughts. I think the key word to focus on here is the qualifier word "probably". Probably isn't an absolute and could easily be replaced with "might". You might be dealing with this the rest of your life. Okay, but to what extent? Will it always take this much energy? Probably not. I think that is much easier to mentally swallow and accept. It may not come as quickly as you'd like. But keep at it because you're worth it. Be patient with yourself, because you deserve that.  I wonder if your therapist was attempting to manage your expectations of being fixed and completely (?) free of it. Anxiety in and of itself isn't "bad", it's when it becomes excessive that it needs to be addressed (which you are doing). Perhaps ask your therapist to elaborate. Could this get easier over time?  
I have been discussing this with my therapist, specifically how my anxieties do usually bring up good points, something I need to pay attention to in my life, and also how although it is a negative thought cycle the anxiety did eventually motivate me to action, which can be a good thing. The way  I’m currently dealing with it is to identify the thoughts brought on by anxiety, then to quiet/ignore them, but also to take note of what my anxieties are being brought on by so I can address them at the appropriate time.  For example, during exercise/meditation anxious thoughts will rush into my mind concerning an unfinished errand. With practice I can notice the harsh anxious “tone” the thoughts have and do my best to change my train of thought, but I will also make a mental note to address that errand later in the day.

My therapist has completely abandoned me so I can’t really relate  
I hope you can try with someone else. There are many factors that go into not just a match but a therapeutic relationship. Maybe they have difficulty beyond what you know. I have gone through this but not to the point of termination. Professionally and ethically, unless you have violated some previously mutually agreed upon terms, they should have a session in which there is closure with recommendations for your continued care. Do yourself justice by persevering and learning how to heal. Don’t let this setback define your path. It doesn’t even if it hurts.  
I mean she just doesn’t respond when I try to make an appointment, even though I’ve been seeing her since I was a child. My psychiatrist is the one who will have to contact her now for my file and that can be shared with my new therapist. I have quiet bpd and I am generally not very open so maybe that’s why she ghosted me. I don’t know. I don’t even think I feel bad about it

Not sure if this question belongs here, but I know someone (in person) who is claiming to others to be a therapist (this person is an older undergraduate student...) I am not sure if they had provided 'treatment' to anyone yet and charged (although something along the lines was mentioned passively in a conversation once). Does something like this get reported ? If so, to whom - the University they're attending? This person HAS worked in a medical setting before so is familiar with insurance billing procedures

Do you just go to a regular therapist? I’ve been wanting to do that with a therapist but I feel like the ones I have gone to are very “surface level” with their stuff... if that make sense. Like what is happening in your life right now that I could help you with? And if nothing, why are you here? Maybe it’s just me idk  
Yeah she's what I'd call a 'regular therapist' not some highly specialized professional or psychiatrist. I've been going to my therapist for almost 2 years and a LOT of what we've talked about has been daily life issues because I've had a lot of current stress but I also had brought up that I had an abusive childhood from the beginning so we've been trying to get there but current life events have been taking more immediate priority.  I think it also helps frame the areas where triggers are clearly happening repeatedly and then we can go into the history for those triggers.  But I'm aware this is going to be a long journey and had put it off for too long thinking I could understand and self-help myself through it all alone. That certainly has been helpful, but there's only so much I can do myself.  I have asked about EMDR therapy but my therapist isn't trained in it so I'd have to work with someone else if I go down that route, which is fine,  I figure that's going to take a while to prepare for too, but hopefully I can get somewhere with this on the meantime.  I definitely feel like there are times that I'm just venting which is okay,  but doesn't feel like it solves much so I guess you have to advocate a little for what you want out of it and find the right therapist.  I'm not even sure if my therapist is the right one, but she's good enough for now at least so I'm happy to stay with her and try this avenue.  
I would not change therapists. To be able to cry is a gift. I know that sounds strange but it is my belief. You have been through so much! You seem to be in a safe space which is why I would stay!

I was having the same problem. Then I found a therapist that practices traditional psychotherapy not CBT. I found CBT to be extremely on the surface and left sessions feeling like I talked about what the therapist wanted me to talk about, not at all what I needed to heal.

Is CBT not part of the psychotherapy umbrella? Or do you mean someone who has the full toolbox of techniques/methods versus just one?

I had essentially the same experience. My therapist specializes in trauma too and we did some inner child work and one session I noticed her eyes get kinda big, and the next session she was clearly horrified (beyond her normal affirmation of my emotions). In the inner child work she asked me to imagine my dad comforting and asked me how it felt. And I told her it felt icky, and I hate him too much to include him in that part of my inner child work because it plays into his narcissism and makes me angry. So after that I started ranting about random memories of him being an asshole, that I felt were just examples of him being an asshole, not particularly horrifying.... and she was so shocked and basically told me— that’s really bad. Because my father didn’t beat me everyday or sexually abuse me, or do some of the classic examples of abuse I see on here, sometimes it’s hard to wrap my mind around how horrible he is. He was 100% emotionally neglectful, he had a horrifying temper that still scares/upsets me think about to this day (he is 6’2” and muscular, so that just compounds the terror of his rage), he just has no humanity and is a pure narcissist (possibly malignant, according to my therapist). And it’s hard to remember, just because my abuse might not have been the worst and he never stuck my hand to a stove burner, that doesn’t mean my abuse wasn’t bad and it doesn’t mean my abuse wasn’t abuse. Since I felt like I was just ranting about him being an asshole, since I thought it was basically about what a fucked in person he is rather than him directly abusing me, I was surprised by her reaction. And her reacting to what I felt was mundane made me start to question how I understand what happened to me. If that made her recoil in horror....  It’s also weird because his actions often don’t look like what you think of “normal” abuse, like what gets described here, but they were definitely abusive.... it was sort of extreme emotional neglect with a tinge of terrifying angry asshole-ism, and pure narcissism to boot. And also just weird-ness. I mentioned before how weird he is about death. And he gets “sentimental” despite literally never bothering to take pictures of us as kids and barely knowing our ages (one time he started writing captions on the backs of old photos and wrote my sister’s and my “ages” on the back of one, but the ages were six years apart and were 4.5 years apart....). He’s so weird!! And that has been a thorn in my side my entire life. Sorry to rant about me. But anyway, I hear you. It happens. And it’s confusing as hell.

The first time I ever went to a therapist he cried. I wouldn't say it was the only reason I never came back but it was one of them. It took me 3 years to make myself find another one. It made me feel like there's something REALLY wrong with me lol. It felt like pity and I didn't like that. But I can see how it could be good for other people. It could feel validating and that the person is truly understood. In the end it's about finding the right person for you and if you feel like you're getting along and he's helping you that's what matters.  It's one of my favourite dark jokes now. "I made a therapist cry". Some of the reactions to that are very amusing.  
Yeah, I would have been very put off if it was the first session when there's a lot of feeling the person out so sharing feels more transactional to give a framework. And each person has their own right to appreciate or be bothered by the reaction, it's not cookie cutter. For me it was fine that she teared up, and appropriate for a person to feel sad or something at an injustice, I didn't feel like she was stealing my experience or making it about herself.  It just threw me in a way that made me feel things more viscerally than I usually try to because I try not to feel that pain for obvious reasons, but... that's why I'm in therapy,  it's no longer a useful coping mechanism to block it out. It's weird. It's validating, it's darkly amusing, it's triggering, and it's depressing to say "I made my therapistr cry" by sharing my childhood experiences.

Sounds like you would benefit from  a therapist who specializes in trauma.  
I've been doing a lot of trauma research lately and reading up on CPTSD. EMDR therapy seems to have the highest success rate of current methods. So that's a future thing to figure out, how to get that started and plan for that journey while also living my every day life... and not letting myself avoid the difficult things.  I wish I could put everything on hold,  take a life sabbatical and just de into this stuff,  like at a camp or something amazing and then hit the play button on the rest of my life. (What, it doesn't work that way? Rats!)

If you don't mind me asking what was the incident? I also think I normalise things that are really quite screwed up and it's sometimes helpful to hear other people's stories for perspective. Like I only realised in my mid-20s having a constant background hum of suicidal ideation isn't normal.   Also in terms of recovery r/mdmatherapy has been a godsend for me in untangling complex trauma (on the off chance it helps you too).  
I'm struggling to respond without too much detail,  as it's the internet...  Severe emotional abuse, manipulations, gaslighting, being witness to violence against my mom over a conflict centered around me. Having no personal autonomy, emotional safety, no space for different wants or needs counter to my parents. Clothing being thrown away and not replaced.  Being abandoned suddenly at 11 and having my things sold off, being told it was no longer worth the custody/whatever struggles with my mom.  
I (15f) am going to kill myself today
Hi honey, you are going to be just fine. Everything is temporary, especially this feeling, even though it may feel never-ending. Ride the wave. You said it yourself, you don't want to do something as silly as hurting yourself when you can be kind to yourself instead. How would you talk to your best friend if they told you this? What about a little sibling, or even a stranger? You can handle the pain, because this is as bad as it gets and you're still here. Push through. Talk to someone. You are not alone. The comments under your post are just a small part of the proof that people care. Breathe.  
I (15f) am going to kill myself today
If you are feeling suicidal now, please stop long enough to read this. It will only take about five minutes. I do not want to talk you out of your bad feelings. I am not a therapist or other mental health professional -only someone who knows what it is like to be in pain. I don’t know who you are, or why you are reading this page. I only know that for the moment, you’re reading it, and that is good. I can assume that you are here because you are troubled and considering ending your life. If it were possible, I would prefer to be there with you at this moment, to sit with you and talk, face to face and heart to heart. But since that is not possible, we will have to make do with this. I have known a lot of people who have wanted to kill themselves, so I have some small idea of what you might be feeling. I know that you might not be up to reading a long book, so I am going to keep this short. While we are together here for the next five minutes, I have five simple, practical things I would like to share with you. I won’t argue with you about whether you should kill yourself. But I assume that if you are thinking about it, you feel pretty bad. Well, you’re still reading, and that’s very good. I’d like to ask you to stay with me for the rest of this page. I hope it means that you’re at least a tiny bit unsure, somewhere deep inside, about whether or not you really will end your life. Often people feel that, even in the deepest darkness of despair. Being unsure about dying is okay and normal. The fact that you are still alive at this minute means you are still a little bit unsure. It means that even while you want to die, at the same time some part of you still wants to live. So let’s hang on to that, and keep going for a few more minutes. Start by considering this statement: “Suicide is not chosen; it happens when pain exceeds resources for coping with pain.” That’s all it’s about. You are not a bad person, or crazy, or weak, or flawed, because you feel suicidal. It doesn’t even mean that you really want to die - it only means that you have more pain than you can cope with right now. If I start piling weights on your shoulders, you will eventually collapse if I add enough weights... no matter how much you want to remain standing. Willpower has nothing to do with it. Of course you would cheer yourself up, if you could. Don’t accept it if someone tells you, “that’s not enough to be suicidal about.” There are many kinds of pain that may lead to suicide. Whether or not the pain is bearable may differ from person to person. What might be bearable to someone else, may not be bearable to you. The point at which the pain becomes unbearable depends on what kinds of coping resources you have. Individuals vary greatly in their capacity to withstand pain. When pain exceeds pain-coping resources, suicidal feelings are the result. Suicide is neither wrong nor right; it is not a defect of character; it is morally neutral. It is simply an imbalance of pain versus coping resources. You can survive suicidal feelings if you do either of two things: (1) find a way to reduce your pain, or (2) find a way to increase your coping resources. Both are possible. Now I want to tell you five things to think about.  You need to hear that people do get through this -- even people who feel as badly as you are feeling now. Statistically, there is a very good chance that you are going to live. I hope that this information gives you some sense of hope. Give yourself some distance. Say to yourself, “I will wait 24 hours before I do anything.” Or a week. Remember that feelings and actions are two different things - just because you feel like killing yourself, doesn’t mean that you have to actually do it right this minute. Put some distance between your suicidal feelings and suicidal action. Even if it’s just 24 hours. You have already done it for 5 minutes, just by reading this page. You can do it for another 5 minutes by continuing to read this page. Keep going, and realize that while you still feel suicidal, you are not, at this moment, acting on it. That is very encouraging to me, and I hope it is to you. People often turn to suicide because they are seeking relief from pain. Remember that relief is a feeling. And you have to be alive to feel it. You will not feel the relief you so desperately seek, if you are dead. Some people will react badly to your suicidal feelings, either because they are frightened, or angry; they may actually increase your pain instead of helping you, despite their intentions, by saying or doing thoughtless things. You have to understand that their bad reactions are about their fears, not about you.  But there are people out there who can be with you in this horrible time, and will not judge you, or argue with you, or send you to a hospital, or try to talk you out of how badly you feel. They will simply care for you. Find one of them. Now. Use your 24 hours, or your week, and tell someone what’s going on with you. It is okay to ask for help. Try:  Send an anonymous e-mail to The Samaritans * Call 1-800-SUICIDE in the U.S. * Teenagers, call Covenant House NineLine, 1-800-999-9999 * Look in the front of your phone book for a crisis line * Call a psychotherapist * Carefully choose a friend or a minister or rabbi, someone who is likely to listen  But don’t give yourself the additional burden of trying to deal with this alone. Just talking about how you got to where you are, releases an awful lot of the pressure, and it might be just the additional coping resource you need to regain your balance.  Suicidal feelings are, in and of themselves, traumatic. After they subside, you need to continue caring for yourself. Therapy is a really good idea. So are the various self-help groups available both in your community and on the Internet.  Well, it’s been a few minutes and you’re still with me. I’m really glad. Since you have made it this far, you deserve a reward. I think you should reward yourself by giving yourself a gift. The gift you will give yourself is a coping resource. Remember, back up near the top of the page, I said that the idea is to make sure you have more coping resources than you have pain. So let’s give you another coping resource, or two, or ten...! until they outnumber your sources of pain. Now, while this page may have given you some small relief, the best coping resource we can give you is another human being to talk with. If you find someone who wants to listen, and tell them how you are feeling and how you got to this point, you will have increased your coping resources by one. Hopefully the first person you choose won’t be the last. There are a lot of people out there who really want to hear from you. It’s time to start looking around for one of them.

Just talking about how you got to where you are, releases an awful lot of the pressure, and it might be just the additional coping resource you need to regain your balance.  Suicidal feelings are, in and of themselves, traumatic. After they subside, you need to continue caring for yourself. Therapy is a really good idea. So are the various self-help groups available both in your community and on the Internet.  Well, it’s been a few minutes and you’re still with me. I’m really glad. Since you have made it this far, you deserve a reward. I think you should reward yourself by giving yourself a gift. The gift you will give yourself is a coping resource. Remember, back up near the top of the page, I said that the idea is to make sure you have more coping resources than you have pain. So let’s give you another coping resource, or two, or ten...! until they outnumber your sources of pain. Now, while this page may have given you some small relief, the best coping resource we can give you is another human being to talk with. If you find someone who wants to listen, and tell them how you are feeling and how you got to this point, you will have increased your coping resources by one. Hopefully the first person you choose won’t be the last. There are a lot of people out there who really want to hear from you. It’s time to start looking around for one of them.

You are 15. I promise it will pass. Life is full of insane ups and downs.  Please don’t leave this world yet. I lost my son to Suicide almost two years ago. He was 19.  He was beautiful. Absolutely beautiful but he didn’t know and he never got the chance to realize it. I miss him every day. The pain of losing someone to Suicide is a pain unlike anything else in this world. Please know you are loved. You have touched more lives than you know and you are so much more important than you realize. You still have amazing things to accomplish. Call the suicide hotline, call a friend, or if your like me talk to your pets. I’m serious everybody cares more than you realize and this world would be a much worse place without you. You are loved. Sending you online hugs. 1-800-273-8255  
I’m sorry for your loss.  
I am too. This world needs to stop losing beautiful people because it is becoming a very ugly place without them. I hope with all my heart that little girl stays with us.

4 years ago when I was your age I was in the exact same place and I went through with or at least tried three times.  I know everyone says this and it never feels like it’s true but it does get better. You are more important than you know.  I just plead with you to listen to this: you are important it may not seem like it and it may not feel like you are in a big way. But you have in the past or will in the future impact someone for the better live for that. Live for the people who you can help. If you can’t live for yourself anymore live for the people around you.  If everything in your life is bad make it your mission to make things better for others. Find a purpose because you are for a reason and you will do great things.  Who knows maybe in four years when you survive you’ll be here in my place looking at a thread that reminds yourself of what could have been and save a life.  I’ve turned my terrible experiences with suicide into something beautiful I have been there for many friends and have stopped several from going through with suicide. Live and become that for someone else.  Please DM me if you want to talk or need anything at all. Please choose life.

100 reasons to not die.   We would miss you.  It's not worth the regret. Either by yourself if you failed or just simply left scars, or the regret everyone else feels by not doing enough to help you.  It does get better. Believe it or not it will eventually get better. Sometimes you have to go through the storm to get to the rainbow.  There's so much you would miss out on doing.  There is always a reason to live. It might not be clear right now, but it is always there.  So many people care, and it would hurt them if you hurt yourself.  You ARE worth it. Don't let anyone, especially yourself, tell you otherwise.  You are amazing.  A time will come, once you've battled the toughest times of your life and are in ease once again, where you will be so glad that you decided to keep on living. You will emerge stronger from this all, and won't regret your choice to carry on with life. Because things always get better.  What about all the things you've always wanted to do? What about the things you've planned, but never got around to doing? You can't do them when you're dead.  I love you. Even if only one person loves you, that's still a reason to stay alive.  You won't be able to listen to music if you die.  Killing yourself is never worth it. You'll hurt both yourself and all the people you care about.  There are so many people that would miss you, including me.  You're preventing a future generation, YOUR KIDS, from even being born.  How do you think your family would feel? Would it improve their lives if you died?  You're gorgeous, amazing, and to someone you are perfect.  Think about your favourite music artist, you'll never hear their voice again...  You'll never have the feeling of walking into a warm building on a cold day  Listening to incredibly loud music  Being alive is just really good.  Not being alive is really bad.  Finding your soulmate.  Red pandas  Going to diners at three in the morning.  Really soft pillows.  Eating pizza in New York City.  Proving people wrong with your success.

My therapist told me its unnaturall to be gay
Wow. Unethical and unprofessional. Especially for a therapist. Do not go back.  
I wish therapists received health safety inspections like how restaurants do. Send in someone undercover, push at the therapists to see if their responses could be damaging to the patients, and then give them a score and include where they went wrong. This one would fail and be shut down. Slap a big red F on the door to his practice  
My therapist told me its unnaturall to be gay
Report him to the local licensing board. He needs to be sanctioned.

I second this. As a therapist, we need these therapists to be reported. They make a bad name for our profession and damage people. I’m sorry this happened to you but please report to the state licensing board. Especially right now?! F this crap makes me fume.

Sorry this happened to you. In addition to what all the previous commenters said (DEFINITELY never go back), some therapists can be reviewed on Yelp, Google, etc. I would give him the lowest possible rating, and then calmly restate the facts of what happened. Even if he is never punished officially, he will lose a great deal of business, as he should.  
My therapist told me its unnaturall to be gay
Do not go back. We are all entitled to our opinion. However this therapist will not be able to help you with that attitude. Please find another. Therapy should make you feel comfortable, accepted, and wanted.  
Some opinions are blatant lies. He’s a homophobic asshole  
If you are allowed to believe what you like, so is everyone else.

You should read up on hormones and gene expression. Being gay is as natural as anything else your body does, because...your body does it.

Wow that's awful. You need to get a therapist that will help you, not one who will tell you that you're a problem.  
I mean, not in this context, but a therapist might have justification for telling you that you're a problem.   E.G. any abusive or narcissistic asshole who has a therapist.

True. But if a therapist believes his patient is a dick, he should still try to find a way to say it that's wouldn't be taken as offensive. After all, the goal is to help the patient.

 Being gay IS NATURAL. 2. Your therapist is unprofessional and you need to report him. Shut him down.   
YES, and before anyone gets a chance to snowball this into "Let's just shut everyone down we don't like," he is violating his duty and if I didn't do my work because I didn't like the client's "lifestyle" (god DAMN do I hate that word), I'd be fired immediately. So yes, let's shut everyone down who refuses to do their job for bullshit reasons.  
I hate the ‘cancelled culture’, but i feel like this may be an example I would look the other way. He needs to be informed, have evidence of thi happening and if it is true he needs to be shut down before he hurts someone else.  
Agreed on all points. Cancel culture is definitely BS, but when it’s a mental health “professional,” they could actually harm someone and THAT needs to be dealt with. This is where that sort of outrage should be placed, not on some ignorant idiot rando on Twitter...

My therapist told me its unnaturall to be gay
Christian therapist? Sigh.  
Did he say it was a Christian therapist? I didn't see that in his post?  
I know, I am inquiring.  
Understandable, but we must all be careful to not put the carriage infront of the horse.

Yesterday during virtual therapy, I became quite dissociated and as my therapist was helping me become grounded again, a fucking bird flew full speed into the window directly in front of my desk. I was quickly startled back into reality, and it startled my therapist too because she heard it happen! We died laughing about it through the rest of the session.

“It be like that sometimes”: the product of a generation that can’t afford therapy
It really do be like that sometimes  
Sometimes, it indeed DO be like that  
You can tell by the way that it is.

I empathise, but also, here's some problem solving: I've sort of been in this position many times. When I was doing my undergrad, definitely, but then you have access to student support = sort of free therapy.  There have been other times where I thought I was in this position, but really, with reallocation of funds, I wasn't. I don't think I realised what a priority my mental health was. Reduced some things like, nights out, and was able to. If you have absolutely no spare money, then charity organisations or government support can help.  If you look through the accredited therapy organisations (in the UK it's babcp for cbt, abcs, mct institute for mct, ukcp and bacp for most everything else), and other listings, you can often find someone who doesn't charge too much. A fair few therapists in my experience do reduced rates for low earners.  My person is £40 for a 50 minute session. There are plenty of others who do fees like that.  I usually have fortnightly or monthly sessions, as I don't need more than that. In addition I do sit downs with myself to go over what I need to do/not do.  Also, some charge less for phone or Skype therapy as they don't have to hire a room.  Additionally, there's SO MANY free evidence-based psychotherapeutic materials online. CCI is a good example (I've posted a list here before; let me know if you want links). And you can, I have, made massive improvements using those tools.  Hope this helps.

Whoa that sent chills down my spine! That’s a beautiful epiphany! Now ask yourself “who would I have been if I wasn’t their emotional dumping grounds”  
I'm trying to connect with him. I've gone into the basement and pulled out the shoe box of old pics. Thankfully there's a bunch of pics of that guys happy face. Now I just need to pick up where he got beaten out. Cheers!

People do say shit about other people under their breath. People are assholes. Not all people, all the time though. People also say really nice things under their breath about people. You gotta choose who you want to listen to, and choose which person you want to be. I get cluster migraines. And a warning i am going to get them is weird colors and floating objects beforehand. It is an absolute sign to take some pain pills because I am about to be on the ground in pain. I also have menieres disease so I have a thing called drop attacks where I get very dizzy and the world spins and I get vertigo and have to go down to the ground. It rarely happens but normally for about a half a day before hand I see weird shapes and stuff. I normally do not remember that this is a thing that happens before hand and am surprised every time.  
Yea maybe I'm just over thinking and the world is just nastier than ever now. I don't get migraines, they aren't that painful. They're just stress headaches. I hope you feel better.  
World is nastier than ever right now in my opinion... even kindness is seen as a weakness. Best of luck in figuring everything out.  
Yea being kind nowadays is frown upon, and thank you.

It has always been nasty and horrible. I dont know why people think it is nastier now. Are we kidding? Did you guys skip out on history class ;) I mean, I am not religious but let's get a bible out and read a couple of the early old testament books just for a prime example of nasty. The world has always been nasty. Keep it in perspective. It has also been full of good. And kindness.  And compassion. And love. Just not this post.

Hey, you chose to hear the negative in my post. :)  Some people say nice and happy and positive things.and you can choose to hear them and say them too.  
Its been a long while since someone said something nice to me. Also I'm not going to act on what I hear if a person may have not said something in the first place.

You have clusters?! So does my husband. I’m so sorry to hear that. I was just about to comment about migraines and auras, but I’m glad you got here first. Best wishes.

Look I don’t know why country your in and how people act there or treat people with cerebral palsy. But in my experience that’s absolutely not something that’s common at all among strangers. I think you should go to a psychologist or a psychiatrist and discuss your concerns honestly. The flashes with the headaches is something I’d get checked out as well. Even if it is normal for your mum, it doesn’t mean it’s normal for everyone. The only way to be sure is to talk to a specialist. Either way I hope it’s all okay!

I don't know if you will see this, but strangely it seems like you are getting carbon monoxide poisoning. We had a new rental that had a tenant inside who described similar issues when I was talking to him. He though the issues were psychological in nature and because of that he was on rent assistance and welfare. He experienced auditory and visual hallucinations at home but associated it with his other conditions. When we got all the inspections finished and found the problem, he was a changed man and was able to be gainfully employed again in a matter of months. The location-based headaches and hallucinations are right on track with that diagnosis. The auditory part is a more rare symptom and possibly associated with a gas leak instead. It is a long shot but seems similar to a situation that is often found in older homes. A simple test can rule it out for you.

I might suggest talking to a therapist, as they'll be able to give you better feedback and ask relevant questions to figure out what's going on

i'm not currently working, luckily, but it does seem like all my friends with jobs are having a much harder time dealing with customers right now. i think there is a general level of stress for everyone and some people REALLY externalize all their issues. my friend works at the post office and she says that customers are more irate basically every day. i've also seen a TON of news stories about violence against store employees. it's really upsetting but i don't think it's just you.

It doesn't sound like schizophrenia, so I wouldn't worry too much. As a therapist, I would say it's likely that both A) shitty people are going to say mean things sometimes and also B) when you have an anxiety disorder you are more prone to have a negative bias towards believing that someone is saying something bad about you, especially if you have a fear of being judged or ridiculed. Even if you are hearing things that aren't real, it doesn't necessarily mean you are crazy. Often times it indicates your fears are becoming larger/difficult to control and may need more management. I would strongly suggest seeking professional help from a qualified therapist to help manage this anxiety.  
I have a therapist, he's my fifth one.  
Have you told him about what is happening to you? He won't be able to help you unless you open up and collaborate. If you don't feel comfortable, there are always other therapists. I know it can be frustrating to find a good fit.  
I don't think any amount of talking will fix a thing for me. Only reason I still have him is because I don't have many friends and we have a few things in common.

Literally same. And the worst part is she always quotes me on what I've said in other sessions and I'm like "... Umh okay yeah" and I just agree with her, because me telling her I have a bad memory = me just trying to get out of talking about it, apparently.

Contrary to what many have said here, I believe that writing down something during the therapy session interrupts the flow and delays the process, but I confess that several times I felt like drawing while expressing myself. You do not need to absorb 100% of what was said by the therapist, what counts is how you receive what was said. It is necessary to keep channels opened to take the findings as a large group of ideas and emotions that have no form and that contain a good amount of information that is kept by the unconscious mind. These learnings appear as insights when faced with the problem. It is at this point that we can consciously practice what was covered during the session.

PSA: you can unapologetically outgrow friends. You DO NOT have to explain your reasoning. You DO NOT have to continue carrying people throughout your journey if all they have to offer are dead ends.
I understand that cutting people out of your life is necessary sometimes but why “no explanation”? I feel like everyone should get some kind of explanation if a friend of their’s just suddenly began ignoring them. Even if you think they deserve to be cut out, you should at least let them know, you don’t need to defend your point, simply letting them know that they aren’t serving a purpose in your life is good enough.  
I agree. If I ever at one point was a toxic person or a dead end, I’d want to know, so I myself can come to terms with it and improve.  
Not everyone is like you though and wants to improve. Some get nasty. Some get obsessive. Some get scary.

This. I think sometimes simply moving on without a word is the right thing to do, if nothing good would come of discussing it. Also, if reciprocation was never there. It might be completely fair to walk away without expending the effort to explain, if they never put that kind of effort into you.  This was my exact situation at one point, if you couldn't tell.

My therapist just told me he'd charge me the same amount if I move out 😭
Funny enough I'm in the same situation and my therapist offered to reduce my sessions by 25 dollars helping me save 100 on therapy if I find myself in hard times when I move out. 😭 I feel so indebted to him  
That's amazing how you're experiencing the same thing! It's so great how there's people out there who care enough about their job to literally jeopardize thousands of dollars just to make sure someone can get better. It gives me a much bigger appreciation for therapists. Best of luck to you on your journey!  
My therapist just told me he'd charge me the same amount if I move out 😭
We'd probably see more of this if they didn't have to worry about student loans & elected Bernie to get his Medicare for all & student loan forgiveness.  
That'd be nice.  
My therapist just told me he'd charge me the same amount if I move out 😭
We're taught to do things like this in school. There is even a clause we read in my ethics course that we should waive a fee if the client is really really struggling to pay.  
Oh wow that's interesting. So you're studying to be a therapist then?  
Yup, I forgot to mention therapists are encouraged to do pro bono work if they are able to do so.  
My therapist just told me he'd charge me the same amount if I move out 😭
I'm from France where social security system is better, but therapist are most of the time at least partly on your charge. Personnally, I have to pay 50%, which amount to 25€ per appointment. But my therapist basically lies to the government saying I come see her twice as often as I really do, which means it's eventually as if it were free.  
My therapist just told me he'd charge me the same amount if I move out 😭
I would go that too. Most of us aren’t looking to penalize our patients for their situations. We’re there to help. Good luck!  
So you think what my T suggested was something I should go for? And thank you!  
Absolutely! She/he wouldn’t have offered if they weren’t ok with it. Be well :)  
My therapist just told me he'd charge me the same amount if I move out 😭
That's really nice of them. I wish my therapist would give me a price break so I can go more than once a month, but I'm happy I can do that at least.  
My therapist just told me he'd charge me the same amount if I move out 😭
My therapist is nice enough to give me a slogj discount. From $65 per session to $50 per session. Even the few times I've been late she excused me from the late fee. I do see her 4 times a month tho so seeing her is still my second largest bill other than rent. I do appreciate her so much tho . She's an independent licensed therapist who I was so so lucky to find.
