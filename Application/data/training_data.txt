“People in therapy are often in therapy to deal with people in their life who won’t go to therapy”
In my first session, I told my therapist, "When parents don't go to therapy, their children have to."

Mine told me early on that family trauma trickles down from one generation to the next, until one person puts an end to it. Unfortunately for me that responsibility fell to me. At first it felt like waaaaay too much responsibility but now I’m grateful to myself for doing the work.

ME TOO!!! It’s hard work but it’s worth it. And we’re strong enough to do it 💪

“It ends with me” :) happy to see there’re others in the same boat out there.

I’m in this situation exact situation right now and struggling after 2 sessions but this is why I’ll keep going!

I need an embroidered pillow that says “It’s your Mom” on one side and “It’s your Dad” on the other. 🙄

100 %. I tried getting my dad into therapy years ago .. he went to one free session, cussed out the poor therapist and said he'd never go again. So now I'm literally paying for it.

“People in therapy are often in therapy to deal with people in their life who won’t go to therapy”
For sure. The notion of “Control” is a big thing we we focus on, and the two main categories of what is generally beyond our control/what necessitates acceptance is (1) other people, and (2) the past. Take care of yourself in this moment and all the ones going forward, and to whatever extent doing so helps positively influence those other things/people, that’s just a bonus :)

It's true but isn't it false at the same time? I go to therapy because of a**hole professors (who have crossed every mental boundary that exists on earth) but let's be real... this man has been in therapy for 20 years and it looks like it's amounting to nothing. Or perhaps him going to therapy is all false? Everything he says is false?

Maybe it’s false or maybe it’s true, who knows. I’m sorry you’re in the situation because of someone like a prof. It’s mentally tolling and I have had to report a prof like that because he stepped over boundaries. But one thing I learned in therapy is that sometimes people who have gone or go to therapy are self centred which can happen with or without acknowledgement. They always think “my issues” “or my problems” so it’s always “me me me” so they can never apply their therapy and learning to other people and also think that “hey maybe other people are also going through this issue and I should be sympathetic and compassionate.” Could be a lot of other reasons to but this is the only one that I experienced and deemed to be true in that case. If it makes you feel better, remember profs are extremely temporary and should in no way hold any power or extensive stress over you. I’d report him if he’s mentally or emotionally stressing you to the point where you want to go to therapy. Definitely not cool, no person in that position should have that power. Also, destroy him on rate my prof lol

I'm sorry it happened to you too. I've done my best reporting the man but the corruption in my school is heavy. As someone who was "friends" with most of these professors, chairs, deans, I knew how corrupt the system was. I just didn't know for 4 years that the idiot was abusing me all along -- a psychologist made me see the truth. These people have invaded every aspect of my life. It's no longer temporary as it is for most students. They know exactly who I talk to, what I talk about, who's in my life and they go to extreme lengths to insert themselves into my relationships. It's not even appropriate. The sad fact is that they're wealthy and of power even outside the school - it's like I'm fighting a battle skewed against me. Though I'm winning now, gosh I wish these a**holes don't even know who I am. I can't destroy him on ratemyprof -- he has every student blindly following him. My school is almost 100% low-income, first-generation students who statistically have troubles getting jobs. Just because this professor along with others are getting students jobs, these students are freaking following him like a cult. I can't count the number of students who got the job from him then ditched his ass after graduating. The shit thing is that because of therapy, I am so conscious of what's happening that I won't let myself go through this shit. If I were still the same me from the past, I'd suck it up, go through this as invisibly as possible, and say f*** you all to them. Sadly, that's not a possibility anymore because practically every professor knows who I am before I even begin the class.  But regardless :x you're right that therapy makes some people self-centered! Honestly, I somewhat don't even care about other human beings anymore unless I have reason to. I've noticed that people have always needed help more than I did, just that they're struggling in some way that made it seem like I was the problem.

We had that happen at our school. Eventually so many students reported him he got fired. People know. There are people who see the truth of what's happening.

At least you're school had the balls to dismiss him. Other places would let the degradation continue and other people would be victimized as a result. I remember two incidents in my old high school from when I was a sophomore that involved one teacher in a romantic relationship that the student confessed to and another one left due to her assaulting a student in a fight despite the student defending himself from another attacking him. Both teachers were out by the end of the week and I never heard from them again.

I wish someone would report him in my school sigh or maybe it's happening and I'm not knowing. Whatever the case is, I hope something happens.

“People in therapy are often in therapy to deal with people in their life who won’t go to therapy”
I understand this completely! I am an adult but for financial reasons, still live at home with my parents. Last year, I decided to go to therapy to get help with issues stemming family tension that has been building up ever since I was born. This tension affects and my daily life which is why I need help to cope with it.  I have  rocky relationship with my brother which is another big reason I have decided to go for therapy. I want our relationship to be better then it is. Surprisingly enough, he is actually the only one who has been supportive of me through all of this.  My Dad has no idea I am going and my Mom is completely against it saying that I shouldn’t be there talking about private family issues. I’ve suggested for years that we all go for family counseling but both my parents refused. Yet now that I have took it upon myself to get help, they (at least my Mom) is furious about it.  Don’t get me wrong, she is an amazing mother and would do anything for me! It’s just therapy is a hot button issue for her and as much as I try to avoid talking to her about it, she keeps bringing it up. I know my Dad would flip out if he knew so I am avoiding even telling him yet.  I am just glad I have a therapist to tell me that I should not feel shamed for wanting to get help and that I shouldn’t feel guilty about talking about personal family issues in counseling.

So true.  I’m in therapy because my dysfunctional parents and older sister won’t go to therapy because there is a stigma in Asian communities about seeing a therapist.

Yes, but you grow more by aiming for the place where you no longer need them to behave conditionally in order to feel good.

totally this! i got stuck in the "why won't they go to friggin therapy" loop for a while, especially since two of my therapists have also expressed exasperation that this person won't go to therapy (!) - but i'm really trying to get out of that feedback loop, cos what's the point. and anyway, for me, if i could hit the 'make em go to therapy' button there'd still be previous shit in my brain that needed sorting, and if they'd been going to therapy since forever then we're just in fantasy world. but boy oh boy do i wish there was a 'make em go to therapy' button.  
Anyone else feel like they wouldn’t need nearly as much therapy if their friends and family would go to therapy?
More like I wouldn’t need so much therapy if friends and family just gave more of a damn about me.  Therapy is essentially holding space for someone to be whatever they are. Why can’t everyone just do this so I don’t have to pay someone who doesn’t even care about me to do it.

Friend, you’ve just nailed it!  
Anyone else feel like they wouldn’t need nearly as much therapy if their friends and family would go to therapy?
This made me laugh and immediately think to my mom. I think if she had made it a priority to go and get counseling it would have made my life a lot easier, especially my life in therapy. But like u/oatmeal1977 said, at least we are learning to break this conditional cycle of needing them to be good for us to be good.

Some people need therapy because of family or friends.  
Anyone else feel like they wouldn’t need nearly as much therapy if their friends and family would go to therapy?
I can see why we would get along better and have less stress if everyone *else had their shit together, but if we had good emotional regulation skills we would not have the issues that lead us to therapy ourselves except maybe for short term life changes wanting extra or private support. I love that children are supposedly being taught mindfulness and emotional skills in school now; that will go a long way towards what you suggest. But really we won't be affected by life and our thoughts if we have our own proverbial shit together.  
Anyone else feel like they wouldn’t need nearly as much therapy if their friends and family would go to therapy?
If my parents and my husband’s parents had worked on themselves before exposing their children to all their toxicity, a whole lot of misery could well have been avoided by an entire generation in our families. We’re both pieces of work, constantly working on ourselves so our kids aren’t as messed up as we are.

Have you ever thought about not surrounding yourself with toxic people? Instead of blaming others, look at yourself first. You're in control of who you associate with on daily basis. “Incredible change happens in your life when you decide to take control of what you do have power over instead of craving control over what you don't.” ― Steve Maraboli

True, true, but that’s also one of the reasons I go go therapy.

OMG YESSS. It can often feel like I'm the responsible, healthy one, and the lack of understanding that my loved ones may have for things like healthy boundaries, expectations, processing, and communication results in me questioning myself and all the healthy ways I have learned, in addition to being unravelled from their chaos, of course.  And if I want the relationship to improve, I feel compelled to share with them all of the things I worked so hard and spent so much time and energy to learn in therapy, yet it often falls on deaf ears. Then I have to decide, is this a healthy relationship for me to continue to pursue? But you can't always fully avoid familial relationships!

For some reason I will lash out at people for no reason and when we calm down I appologise. I have some mental illnesses but I never use them as an excuse and those of you who do are messed up, it's not cool to use mental illnesses as an excuse when you lash out. Forgive and forget don't make excuses.

Your mental illness is not an excuse to hurt others
This can go for any illness including Autism which this is an issue for us given we can get upset easily over little things.  A lot of us have communication issues and recently I got into a arguement over what my brother said to me about a game he was playing. He called me a backseat gamer and I feel that's a bit of an insult. I don't play a lot of the same games that I do so I may misunderstand things but that's not an excuse on his end to do what he did and he nearly messed up something dear to me. Instead, he tried to assault me and I pretty much took the fall for the whole thing since my mom sided with him. I still feel bad but I don't have money to seek help for all these issues which is why I'm filing disability to get some insurance to help me financially as well as on the health front so I don't get into debt trying to seek help sooner rather than later. PTSD is awful but still no excuse to abuse others and mistreat people period. There's help for you to get better where for us autistics, it's a life sentence of suffering that we have to deal with.

This is why I said that it is not that simple.  Re-actional anger is not the same.  I would get angry too in your shoes. I don't see how this is little.  He insulted you, this is not nice. And all that followed for sure is fair to get angry about! I would be pissed for sure.  I really wish you all the best!

Your mental illness is not an excuse to hurt others
I was a garbage person to my loved ones. In my first marriage it culminated in a super toxic environment because we were both mentally ill and had no diagnosis so it was just crazy feeding crazy 24/7. After my divorce, I thought I was finally happy and that I had just been unhappy because my ex husband was a butthole(to keep it pg). Everything was going great, started dating my best friend about a year later. Life was perfect. But then, my childhood caught up with me. I was sexually abused & raped almost my entire childhood. I was groomed to think it was normal. Even when I figured out it wasn't normal, I made justifications like "it's my purpose in life" "it kept my family together" "he did all the good dad things". Well my best friend/boyfriend was watching me make these kinds of justifications and concessions to my family Every. Single. Day. I would spend time at their house every day. I was very close to my family. My mom was aware, and we all just pretended like nothing ever happened. Because the family unit was more important. I never viewed it as a problem, because I thought I had dealt with it and coped. But really my coping was binge drinking through my teens until I got pregnant by my future husband and couldn't drink anymore, and all my focus was then on my kid and I never acknowledged my abuse after that. So at 25 my best friend/boyfriend told me I needed help, and I didn't get it because I couldn't accept that anything was wrong with me, because I was happy, I just had a bad thing happen to me but I want defined by that. And I could stay happy if I didn't acknowledge the bad stuff. Fast forward a year, he encouraged me to report my abuse. Which unleashed the trauma and PTSD in full force. In the two years of investigation and waiting for trial, I was not ok. I had lost my entire immediate family by reporting. I was depressed, anxious, angry, had unstable moods, disassociating, had flashbacks, nightmares, was pushing people away, accused my now best friend/fiancee of cheating, manipulating, lying etc. I was so angry all the time that I could not handle any extra stress. Like, I lost it because I couldn't peel an egg one night and started screaming at my fiancee and kid. I was literally unable to regulate my emotions, and it was extremely overwhelming. I would explode and then I would cry. And I would do that on repeat, for months. I finally realized I was being a terrible person, not because I am a terrible person, but because there was something really wrong with me. I hated the person I was becoming. I'm the kind of person who likes gardening, volunteering, family time, going on adventures, playing with my dog, cooking, and just enjoying life. And I was not a person who could do any of those things anymore. So about a month before we finally went to trial, I got into a therapist, and saw a psychiatrist.  Therapist worked with me on trauma responses, and managing stress. Psychiatrist got me on mood stabilizers and anti anxiety meds. By the time the trial came around I was feeling a lot better, and was able to testify without losing myself. It came back as a guilty verdict. After the trial, it was like a literal wave of peace washing over me. All the fear, anxiety, and combativeness dialed way down. I felt pretty ok, but I still had to learn how to manage my mental health. So I continued therapy. We did lots of trauma work, and my therapist also told me she wanted to refer me to dialectical behavioral therapy, for borderline personality disorder. So now I have two therapists. In going to therapy and now knowing what's wrong with me, a lot of my past situations make so much more sense. I now know why I reacted to things the way I did, and with such intensity.  I can't tell you how many times I've apologized to my fiance and kid. I'm still apologizing and trying to be the person they deserve. I even apologized to my ex husband. He's not without blame because he was a gaslighting cheater with anger issues, but because of my own issues we would feed off of each other and spiral off into crazy toxic abuse land. Now 6 years after we split we are finally able to spend time together co-parenting. I don't think mental illness is a justification to do the things I did. Because justification infers that I actively meant to do it or that it was warranted. I never wanted to be the way I was. I never wanted to hurt my family. I was broken.  It's not a justification, but it is an explanation. And I think once you can finally recognize it, you have to get help. Kind of like addiction, no amount of other people telling you you need help is going to work, you need to hit your rock bottom and realize it yourself.  I'm thankful every day for my fiancee and kid. They loved me when I was unlovable, knowing that someday I would be me again. They picked me up when I was broken, and they understood that what I was going through was too much for one person to handle and they took as much as they could for me. And even when I was angry and saying hurtful stuff, they always responded with love. They didn't deserve what I put them through, but they do deserve the person I am now, and I'm glad they stuck around so I could be the best mom and fiance I could be for them.  
Your mental illness is not an excuse to hurt others
Aaaamen. If we crumble and lash out here or there, we have to own up to it, explain ourselves and work on not repeating it.  It's one thing to struggle - it's another to just decide that a behaviorial pattern is okay. One of my mantras is "A reason is no justification." and mental illness being used as an excuse is actually how I came up with it. Sometimes when I get scared, I don't clam up but start yelling instead. It's a defense mechanism. It never occured to me to just decide that makes it okay - when it happens, I stop myself within two minutes max, apologize and focus on my healthier copes. It's a lot easier to empathize with people who are actually trying.

Same! He... or "with great power, comes great responsibility"  and... well, isn't Apex Predator the most powerful animal on the planet? And yet, we are running like responsibility like the plague, but it catches on eventually, in the form of wild fires and diseases. It's all connected. We need to take responsibility on every level of our lives!

Would you know of any subreddits/groups I could join that encourage this?   I want to heal myself without enabling any bad behaviors.  
If you find one, please let me know.  A lot of the non emabling subreddits seem to be very small/somewhat dead -__-.   Like r/responsiblerecovery gets like 2 posts a month Yeah tho, cPTSD was great when I first found out about it.  However now it seems to be more about people who are stuck and who cannot get out of a victim role. I get how self compassion may be needed but there's a point where it becomes maladaptive.  
Indeed, nicely said. They have not made the leap to survivors. Condemning calling out child abuse hate speech and all that.  I know it. Fear of anger, fear of hate. I was there too. I was condemning anger once as well. I was condemning hate, as well.  One of the things that helped me was the one of my abusers. They told me I should not be angry, forgive them, and let go of hate, because it is bad for me. Sure, it was bad for me, while I was under their care, because any standing up for myself meant sever punishment. This is when it clicked, though. This is when I understood that anger and hate were shamed, because abusers wanted us submissive. And anger and hate are empowering. The slave is sad and submissive, not hateful and angry. I am a slave no more.  This is the difference between victims and survivors. The victims still believe their abusers.  Thank you for sharing this sub. :)

Tbh, that I find that sub usually does have anger - it's just misdirected at others or expressed very passively (almost like the raisedbynarcs sub where it's more of a rant then utilizing it to change yourself for the better). I never really understood why you are so pressured to forgive. I get it isn't a good idea to sit and stew in anger or get revenge kill bill style.  However I don't have to martyr myself in order not to do that.  
Your mental illness is not an excuse to hurt others
I definitely have re-actional anger. I can call out bullshit and abuse a mile away and will hold my ground when confronted. My issue is that I have DID, and my blackouts are triggered by extreme stress and frustration. I would never intentionally harm someone because I was mad at them, but during a blackout I can get violent af. Chocking others, slamming them to the wall, grabbing them and yanking them around, I get dirty. I have been working really hard on walking away before I get too far, but when someone is intentionally attacking me it's instinct to react aggressively (especially if my calmer way of problem solving isn't getting through to them).  I know of someone who also has DID and a hairpin trigger. They will go into full tantrum mode; screaming and throwing things, making their "loved one" cowering on the couch while they are in their face screaming. The sad part is, this is ENCOURAGED in the household - they claim holding back on any emotion is unhealthy. Which is true, but there is a HEALTHY way of doing it that isn't going to harm others. From what I've heard the tantrums have lessened but they shouldn't have been tolerated to begin with, as one wrong move can set them back to square one or worse.  Your mental health is NOT an excuse to harm others, EVER.

Totally agree. And actually you find a lot of these people go unchallenged they normalise and rationalise their awful behaviour and get a shock once someone tells them off (I've been that person to do so sometimes haha!)

The world isn't black or white so take on your big boy pants and realize people can react in agressive ways against their own will. I can ensure you, no one with ptsd feels proud of strong or happy, after a trigger, leading to a flashback leading to 100% fight and flight reaction. You have any idea how much people with mental illnesses like PTSD already blame themselves for not being calmer better happier stronger more normal? That's why we need therapy, to hear a therapist say "Your illness isn't your fault, you did not choose it, and to have posttraumatic stress disorder is to be a victim of a response in your brain that is automatic" You sit on a forum reading about people who tries to vent out their fears and scars over this automatic reaction they never chose, and you think  YOU are a good person? You think we should salute you?  Let me ask you. Did you have a choice to not sit in a ptsd group to mock people and get likes on this post for your bullying? What is YOUR excuse?  To op and you other people, you have a choice to do something better with your mind and body then to be a reddit bully, if you have such low self esteem, I suggest you go to the therapy groups avd I'll gladly help you with your insecurities.

You had me for a little bit, but to say that you hope someone gets traumatized is awful. You of all people should know that you have PTSD goddamnit.  I have been through trauma and I wouldn't wish it on anyone. Yes fight or flight reactions happen and yes, maybe OP doesn't understand them that well. But how dare you wish trauma on someone. I hope you stop being such an ass.  
I get that, but this is also a great example of what I think the post is about. Your comment was abusive, but instead of saying sorry. Now you redirect it to an overreaction and being tired.  Way too many people hide behind their disability instead of owning up to their mistakes.  
Or, they just have not learned how to do that yet. They need a space to learn, and people to teach them - because nobody in their life did and has or is.  That isn't to say that is okay, but part of having empathy and an open mind is to realize that when somebody is lashing out and being angry that there are a billion reasons why and that normally it has everything to do with them and nothing to do with you.  Should they learn how to control it and master it? Yes. Is it okay to lash out at others and then say "oh, that was my ptsd...."....yes. absolutely. The next step, once you recognize that is to take steps and responsibility for it and learn how to take care of it. But not everybody has had the resources to do that or is at that point or in the environment that they realise they are able to do so. Wheb somebody is talking about lashing out at another person... you worry about whether that person is okay. But you are not talking to that person. You are talking to the person who lashed out. You can suggest making amends and apologising. There are ways you can make a difference.  But just saying "you are hiding behind your illness and making excuses" is harsh and will make already defensive and angry people angry and defensive. You have to read the room, to be honest.

If I wasn't sorry I wouldn't care to comment and tell you that you were right in the first place, I think demanding too much from people who have showed they're sorry can make them stop caring and put their attention where it's better appreciated, it's abusive to be so controlling, everybody shows they're sorry in different ways, not only your way.

I just wrote an entire response thinking this was the CPTSD sub and proved my own point to myself really really hard. The internet space is hard to navigate communicationally. Sorry if you get weird notifications!

Some people don’t have a choice, the “disability” can control every aspect of your life, and some people don’t have the resources to get help. Sometimes, even with help available, people don’t want to change or feel undeserving of it. I never think we should blame these people for their actions. Instead of expressing hate for others, we should be supportive, understanding, and give them the help they NEED.  
I agree, this post was ignorant and pissed me off, I’m sick of dealing with these kinds of people. I would never wish trauma on my worst enemy, but I will say this post is offensive to anyone and everyone with ptsd and otherwise.  
Yeah like we don't have enough to deal with already. I forget that some people they project things, this person just wanted to push me down no matter what I did to raise themselves.

Op was absolutely the asshole here and in the ptsd post too.  He just won't admit that he was a bully because if he does he'll be no better than his abusers.  I get it.  I make myself live an impossible standard.  Fuck up, and you're no better than your abusers.  Only thats not true.  People make mistakes.  And thats all abuse is.  A mistake.  And its up to us to go from "grr I hate them and want them to burn in hell" to "they made a mistake.  And life is full of people who make mistakes."  If you still hate your abusers, there's no way you'd be even willing to admit the second part.

I agree with you, but they can't help it and they don't know that they're doing it.  
When I asked the therapist for some water, she looked at me curiously and said "Does that have a special meaning to you, water?"
This is hilarious. I have to ask my therapist why he actually gives me a cup of water when I ask for one.

Maybe she thought water was a comfort item for you!? Like when you get overwhelmed you drink water and she was trying to figure that out?  Idk that’s so weird, but I’m giggling. I can’t even imagine how I would have reacted. Probably like, “idk clearly it has meaning to you, what does it mean for you?”

therapist here! It is custom to always have a cup of water available and ready for clients. But, I have observed a pattern in certain clients who drink a lot of water during the session especially when they are overwhelmed. I will sometimes challenge that, much much later in the therapy process to see if drinking water is being used to dissociate from the feeling in that moment (this is why we don't generally allow eating, smoking or coffee/tea drinking in session). edit: I am now realising my own therapist never has a cup of water for me in the room. I always have a water bottle on me, so I only realised this now after reflecting on your post. Strange.

So my therapist probably would hate if I smoked my vape during session? Jk. I’d never do that 😂 That’s good insight! And interesting.

I was just thinking how strange ut is that people bring water bottles and actually find the time to drink during session. Then i realized I always bring a cup of coffee, and it's a great excuse to shut up for a minute

For some reason I imagined a little porcelain cup complete with saucer and spoon, carried carefully (as not to spill it) all the way to the therapist's office.

Oh wow, I’m in therapy for my dissociation and I pretty much drink half a bottle every session...

I'm also in therapy for dissociation! my therapist always wants to give me some tea but I always take the water, tea makes my mouth even drier lol  
Oh wow, I’m in therapy for my dissociation and I pretty much drink half a bottle every session...  
Wow, I wonder what it would be like if you mindfully didn’t reach for your bottle till the end of the session, or maybe didn’t take it at all.

My mouth and lips get sooo dry that it feels like my lips get glued together so I’d probaly just dissociate even more but I think I’ll bring it up with my Theraphist in the next session. Mouth dryness is a super common side effect for tje ADHD meds I take tho so that probaly contributes to it altough my mouth pretty much only gets dry when I’m nervous

Many people use water to self soothe or maybe take a break so it’s okay! I would challenge it if it becomes an unresourceful coping mechanism.

Wow, I’d never thought about drinking during a session being used to disassociate.  It makes total sense, as I’m always carrying a mug/bottle of water. I can actually feel the relief in pausing my statement to take a sip. Wow. 🤯 Edit - can’t into can, because that changes the whole dang context.

Is this a therapist in therapy? Oh dear

LOL You handled it nicely. I have a tendency to be curt so I would have said “the F is that supposed to mean?”

Should've said that instead. Then I'd have some more clarity now.  
Well I'm not sure whether I should. This was really the only strange thing during the session, the rest was fine. But, it was really weird.   If I see her again, I'll follow up!  
If you do see her again, I'd make a point to bring a water bottle and at some point, take a drink and point out that you brought your own this time!  Then again, I think making jokes or making light of things is a bit of a coping mechanism for me.

My second therapist’s office had a policy that a glass of water awaits the client in the office (I saw them briefly for 4 or 5 sessions) which I got used to.  So when I started seeing my current therapist I was dissapointed by the lack of water. At some point we discussed how I would appreciate water there, which prompted me to share a story from my childhood where as a little kid, I would nightly ask my parent for a glass of water before they turned off the light in my room for sleep. I don’t think it was due to thirst. I think I wanted to postpone going to sleep. And also somewhere in me it was a reassurance they care about me. At least a little bit. So my therapist getting water for me is a mark of care I guess on some level. On a bad day I sometimes wonder if it’s a bother getting water for me.  We also had a conversation about the box of tissues at some point. She would usually pull them out when I started crying. And I told her I prefered having them at the table from the start.

Okay yeah I get that, for some people there probably is some deeper meaning behind that. Maybe she had other patients where that was the case..   Thanks for sharing your story anyway

A good reminder for myself to keep carrying my own water to session! Ha. I really needed a laugh today, and this did it! Sorry, not laughing at the situation or the analysis of it, but just the “wtf” moment you must have had.  Like, I’m thirsty? My mouth is dry? (Unless, of course, you DO have some greater meaning behind water. If that’s the case, I too am suddenly curious! 😉)

(Unless, of course, you DO have some greater meaning behind water. If that’s the case, I too am suddenly curious! 😉)  
Hahah, always a pleasure. I honestly didn't know whether to laugh or be weirded out by it. But really the biggest wtf moment of this year (after Covid of course).  
When I asked the therapist for some water, she looked at me curiously and said "Does that have a special meaning to you, water?"
Oh my!! I think she forgot to give you water! I would actually just bring water next time and make a comment about it -- like I brought my own water this time since I was so thirsty all session last week. :P

Yeah I also thought about doing that haha

Haha, why yes, it's essential to my ongoing survival :)  
When I asked the therapist for some water, she looked at me curiously and said "Does that have a special meaning to you, water?"
Be like "ya its got a special meaning, as in if I dont drink it, it'll mean I'll die of thirst".  Wth seriously lol  
When I asked the therapist for some water, she looked at me curiously and said "Does that have a special meaning to you, water?"
Oh god this is hilarious. She is a complete caricature of a therapist, overanalysing ever move you make. I can’t believe you had to spend the whole session dry mouthed and thirsty!

Yeah I had that stereotypical image of a therapist in my head when they are portrayed in a humorous kind of way and only didn’t laugh because I was also hella weirded out  
When I asked the therapist for some water, she looked at me curiously and said "Does that have a special meaning to you, water?"
I actually use drinking water as a coping mechanism when I am really emotional so this makes sense to me.  I tend to bring a cup of tea with me to sessions I know will be intense because the act of stopping and drinking something brings my emotions down and helps regulate them. I’ve done this since I was a teenager and I make sure my therapists know this is a self regulating coping mechanism.

Interesting. I probably do this too, but have never thought about it much.  I drink a lot of water at home and in the car, and almost always drink tea in session (as does my T). It is a good pause in my thinking and feeling to bring things down a notch or so.

This made me laugh! Maybe ask her next time you see her?

Ha ha the same happened to me. I asked her to speak louder and she said "Is the problem really my volume?" - I was so confused

When I asked the therapist for some water, she looked at me curiously and said "Does that have a special meaning to you, water?"
I once asked my therapist for a glass of water (once in like 1,5 years). She got up and got it for me, no big deal. The next time, she was talking about how I ask from people to take care of me when it's not needed, and what was her example? The freagin' water.

Y'all are putting too much thought into being thirsty. You are talking excessively and with emotion. Of course you're thirsty. Therapists taking it as anything else is just....odd...

That gave me a good laugh, but I can relate. I’ve noticed water calms me down. I usually have a glass by me during therapy to just refresh

This thread is making me so thirsty lol glad I have water next to me

Good for you haha. I went straight to the bathroom after the session to drink some water from the sink.

That therapist just crazy, did she gave you the water?

Nope haha

That's just evil. Seriously unless you feel really good with her from now on, I'd look for someone else. She doesn't sounds professional. I was always offered water

I agree that it's weird. It's too funny though. I'm searching for a therapist and I feel like I'm just gonna break down crying. I've been holding it in for almost 7 months and only talked to a relationship coach recently. He validated my feelings but I don't like how he said that we shouldn't be anyone's priority. I guess he meant that we shouldn't rely on anyone or put our whole life into them.

I don’t think it’s ok he said that. You go to therapy because you can’t cope with your own problems yourself anymore. Isn’t that kind of the point? Sorry you had that experience!

Yeah. I think he's possibly messing people up and scamming them. But I needed someone to talk to. Still searching for a therapist! Thanks

That is the weirdest thing I’ve ever heard of. I don’t know if I could go back to her if she did that to me. I would wonder if we were speaking the same language or even if we were from the same planet. It’s so disorienting to ask for water and not have the person understand you even when you are both speaking the same language.  Your therapist should get what you are saying and it sounds like this woman did not get you at all.

Yeah, I felt like I’m in the wrong movie or sth. Still debating with myself whether I should go back or not. Unfortunately she’s pretty much the only therapist I could find that has a spot available now.

I don’t know what I’d do because I’m super non-confrontational.  I hate that there’s no one else you can see.

Lol are u serious....your therapist sounds nut  
When I asked the therapist for some water, she looked at me curiously and said "Does that have a special meaning to you, water?"
I really don't like it when this happens. I'd hate it if everything I did was questioned. Obviously some things need to be questioned, but water? That's ridiculous. Sometimes we just need someone to hold our hand or have some water if we're upset.

Sounds like a therapist who’s read the books/done the studying but doesn’t actually understand how to be a good therapist

I've been offered water, in therapy, and it seems very strange to me that your therapist would be so deep into her analytical thinking that she'd want to interpret something deeper than the basic need for hydration.  
When I asked the therapist for some water, she looked at me curiously and said "Does that have a special meaning to you, water?"
That’s so absurd but so funny. I just drink tea or bring my water bottle (pre-covid). Teletherapy is dope though. I video chat with my therapist every week.  
When I asked the therapist for some water, she looked at me curiously and said "Does that have a special meaning to you, water?"
That's so crazy. I just went to my first therapy appointment last week and right off the bat the therapist asked me if I wanted a glass of water. I told her yes as it would give me something to do for a few seconds as I was very nervous. She then went on to explain she asks everyone if they want water as drinking enough waters very important to start having a healthy mind. she says she believes in the concept that water can "wash away" anxiety, even just a tiny bit alongside other methods.  
When I asked the therapist for some water, she looked at me curiously and said "Does that have a special meaning to you, water?"
LOL that's a little funny haha. I'd just ask her during your next session! Some therapists, because they are human, are a little weird tho so if you notice other stuff or if more esoteric tendencies reveal itself you might reconsider your choice of therapist (unless you like that).

So you’d say that this behaviour goes into the direction of esoterica? Cause that’s really not at all my thing. I’ll have a lookout for it in the next session

the particular way you described the situation - yes. It's not my thing as well. I had similar concerns with my therapists and i just talked openly about it because sticking to science and reason is important to me if i want to open up to someone so i just told her that. It worked out well  
When I asked the therapist for some water, she looked at me curiously and said "Does that have a special meaning to you, water?"
You should of told her it keeps you alive and see if she tries to find a deeper meaning or realises that you just needed to quench your thirst

Reminds of a time where for a period of a few months my therapist would say at the end of every session “drink plenty of water” But never IN the session..  
When I asked the therapist for some water, she looked at me curiously and said "Does that have a special meaning to you, water?"
My therapist always offers but I always carry a drink bottle

I dont know about other people, but I use water when I'm about to cry. I personally hate crying, so I tend to use me drinking my water bottle as an excuse to take a breather. This might sound weird but she might have wanted you to be uncomfortable, not in a malicious way, but in a therapeutic way. When you're not allowed to take those pauses and regain your composure, you're true feelings and emotions might emerge.  I really dont know her intentions, but just a thought

Thanks for sharing. Yes I also came to the conclusion that she probably wanted to get a bit more out of me. Super weird technique, but it actually worked somehow

Are you being treated for an eating disorder? And that is crazy. She is funny as hell. Next time ask for vodka.

Hahaha sure as hell should do that.  Nope, don’t have an eating disorder or alcoholism or any kind of addiction. But well this happened only like 15 minutes in to our very first session, so I guess she couldn’t know that yet.

It’s like the scene out of This Is Us when Randall sees a therapist  
When I asked the therapist for some water, she looked at me curiously and said "Does that have a special meaning to you, water?"
Depending on the style of therapy. Things like water, tissues, whether you help yourself to tissues , timing etc are all interpreted . The way I see it , she refused to provide you with nurturance - the water- as not to mother you on the first session .  Just bring your own next time  
When I asked the therapist for some water, she looked at me curiously and said "Does that have a special meaning to you, water?"
That’s very strange indeed haha I’ve never went to a therapist yet tho, I want to but I’m scared and I don’t think I need one that much I’m just a very paranoid anxious person it’s not ruining my life but I know my life would be a lot better if I didn’t have this shit getting in the way. Do you think that’s a good reason to go to a therapist?  
When I asked the therapist for some water, she looked at me curiously and said "Does that have a special meaning to you, water?"
You just surprised her with your request. If client asked me for some water, which they have, I tell them there’s a fountain down the hallway. Sometimes a cigar is just a cigar.  
When I asked the therapist for some water, she looked at me curiously and said "Does that have a special meaning to you, water?"
You know in some movies how when people start talking about something or someone comes up to someone and they dont want to deal with the situation so they drink all there class then be like oops gotta get more maybe she thought you where trying to do something like that?  
When I asked the therapist for some water, she looked at me curiously and said "Does that have a special meaning to you, water?"
Also dry mouth is a sign of anxiety so maybe she thought that

This sounds like she was utilising techniques that can induce a light trance and she was concerned that if she gave you water it would break this. By deliberately misinterpreting your request she hoped to take your mind off the stressed state of your sympathetic nervous system so that she could continue the session. Or perhaps she was testing the strength of the hypnotic state.

That’s odd though, cause she didn’t say or do anything in the first 10 minutes when I was talking (up until the water question). Not sure how she’d put me into a trance. Also, wouldn’t that be kind of unethical since I didn’t sign up for a hypnosis?

Sounds like she didn't need to say anything. A lot of psychological techniques can induce trance states and they can be pretty benign. But what concerns me here is that she was more interested in getting information from you than being mindful of your physical needs. Not that she's likely to admit to that, it'd be very difficult for you to prove anything. Unless there's extenuating circumstances you're probably better off just going elsewhere.

Was there a possibility to have water? I mean could you see the water and why did not you just get up and get it? I am just curious if water was available. It is not usual thing that therapist provide water.

Forgive yourself. Not just once. Again and again. As many times as it takes to find peace.
This is the one concept that’s really stuck with me through my time in therapy. It’s incredibly hard to do for me, because I tend to blame myself for everything and have an intense self loathing for where I am in life. Yet there are those times of relief when I can hold back all of the self hatred, and even just for a moment forgive myself for all the things I love to hate about myself. To let it all go, defusing into the past. Thanks for reminding me of this. I needed it today.  
Forgive yourself. Not just once. Again and again. As many times as it takes to find peace.
Thank you, this is such an important reminder in these times.  
Forgive yourself. Not just once. Again and again. As many times as it takes to find peace.
Great reminder! I would inwardly roll my eyes when my therapist would say “Be gentle (or kind) to yourself” at first. What changed my perception was thinking about how as a teacher I show young kids how to apologize and forgive sincerely. They pick up on insincerity, so you have to mean it and you have to be gentle when they make mistakes so they don’t shut down and continue to trust you. I gave myself that same empathy and patience and it changed everything! Eliminated a lot of anger and anxiety over things out of my control or mistakes in the past. It’s not about embracing your inner child or anything like that, but treating yourself like the person you love most and wouldn’t be an iota as mean to.  
Forgive yourself. Not just once. Again and again. As many times as it takes to find peace.
Whoops, included a link earlier, but wanted to encourage checking out Sheldon Kopp, who offers a great reminder of this and many excellent insights in his Eschatological Laundry List.  A helpful tool that I've used over and over again throughout the years to help with self-compassion.  
Forgive yourself. Not just once. Again and again. As many times as it takes to find peace.
forgive yourself, forgive others, let go of the past & move forward, every day spent in the past is another day wasted, it’s easy to get consumed by the cycle, it’s hard to let go of, but once you do then you will find absolute & utter peace  
Forgive yourself. Not just once. Again and again. As many times as it takes to find peace.
It is really difficult to do it even once and when you finally to forgive yourself, something else happens and you start blaming yourself for that. How to forgive yourself or just believe in the thought that shit happens and it's not your fault?  
Forgive yourself. Not just once. Again and again. As many times as it takes to find peace.
Is there anything someone could do where the advice would be 'consider that you behaved badly here and need to change'? Of course you can forgive yourself while acknowledging that you did something wrong, but I feel like therapy rarely focuses on that aspect of the process, and I know so many people who mess up their own lives over and over because of their selfishness, then just forgive themselves and make excuses about how they were hurt in the past and were acting out, then move on to wreck another relationship by failing to consider anyone but themselves. I understand the value in this kind of therapy speak for some people, but I also think it gets used by people whose lives could really benefit from some self reflection. Sometimes you actually were in the wrong, and you hurt someone, and maybe it was because of childhood trauma or whatever, but if you carry on hurting the people around you over and over they will leave. Forgive yourself about it all you want but you also have to be considerate if you want to maintain relationships. My ex forgave himself for cheating on his first girlfriend, and his second girlfriend, and his third girlfriend, and for lying to me about not having a girlfriend. Now he's been alone for the last 6 years and is miserable but of course it's all outside of his control. But he forgives himself. Maybe he ought to consider that actually he has some responsibility for each of his relationships failing in the same way, and for the hurt he caused everyone involved, but he'd rather forgive himself instead and never change.

I love when I get a laugh out of my therapist. It makes me feel more validated than a “textbook” answer, honestly. It makes me feel like more of a person

When your Therapist laughs at you
Not quite the same but I was talking to my therapist in our first session on Saturday. We do video sessions like a video chat and I said something made me feel shitty and then I recoiled like I made a mistake. She was like "what did you say?" I sighed and repeated "I said this made me feel shitty" and to my surprise she goes "Oh SHITTY! Alright" I loved it  
When your Therapist laughs at you
Yes, I love when I see my therapists real personality come through either through her laughing or making a sarcastic comment (not towards me, but usually towards whoever I’m venting about). I think that’s usually when you can tell you click with them.  
When your Therapist laughs at you
I’m always laughing with my therapist. She even said she likes to start off her week with me so I always schedule Monday mornings. That makes me feel happy. I was even able to laugh with my 70 year old psychologist who eventually retired. He was awesome. Therapy is so much better when you get breaks from the serious stuff.

Not to take away from your positive experience but "sassy black personality"? I'm not African American, just African, so maybe this is nothing to get offended at but I feel like it's the equivalent of saying "redneck country bumpkin personality" to a white person (granted I don't know your race so...).

Agree. I have to say I absolutely love how “real” women (or people for that matter, but thinking about women) can be. Say what’s really going on and with such open authentic expression. I have such respect for strong women who can just let it all hang out so to speak. Even as a therapist, with mindful consideration, still be expressive in this way that lightens the situation. I’m as white as they come and I think women who have a history of overcoming oppression are generally so dang strong and have gained a license to speak and be so very free. I absolutely love those personalities however they got there. Way too many women are so precautionary and reserved.

I'd like to believe I'm pretty tuned in to black American culture (it's everywhere) and yet I'm having a hard time imagining the stereotype you're referring to. I've met quite a few black Americans and I wouldn't describe them as sassy. I'm trying to think of black actresses and roles they've played and the characters are so diverse I can't even pick out which one of the many is a stereotypical sassy black laugh. And I'm being so serious right now. Which one? And I feel like if I have to ask then maaayyybe it's an offensive generalisation you've just made.

Ya know, it's kinda shitty how you've picked out one simple thing that wasn't meant to be offensive, blew it up out of proportion, and are going on a rant about it. It totally missed the whole point of me sharing this story about my therapy session. If you don't like something someone said on the internet, it is very easy to just scroll past it and let people be.

I find it interesting that you want to play this down. I would not like anyone to tell me I have a 'sassy black personality'. I can't imagine any black person would like that at all. No matter how positively you meant it. I just don't think you should be describing any grown black person as sassy. You know what? Even a child. Just don't call black people sassy. I will not just scroll past this because you need to know. Mentalise shit before you just type. Ask your therapist about mentalising. How would you like it if you order a pumpkin spice latte or whatever and I jokingly remark "oops, your white is showing hahaha lolz" ? It's kinda shitty how you want to ignore the one big thing that makes your post shitty. I wanted to be happy for you but now I really can't.

I'm white and would not be offended in the slightest if somebody called me that. Stereotypes don't always fit an entire population, but there is usually a reason certain stereotypes exist (because there is also a lot of truth in them).

Good work!  You'd be amazed how many people fully believe and insist that they are fine and literally everyone else and all of society is the problem. You're doing ok. Hang in there friend :)

That’s funny in an instant. Its self deprecating humor. Try stand up comedy

Therapy is a great tool to have! I know it’s helped me so much and continues to do so. I think everyone should go to therapy at some point in their lives and they should not get discouraged if it takes a few tries with different therapists to find their fit. I got lucky that the first one I met with was the one that I felt most comfortable with.

What percent of therapists do you think are good therapists as opposed to the horror stories?  
What percent of therapists do you think are good therapists as opposed to the horror stories?  
Any guess on my part would be extremely uneducated lol like I don’t know how many counselors there are here in the US! I do think we likely encounter more horror stories compared to the percentage of therapists who are terrible—I think it’s easy to write and read and be outraged by the horrible ones. That said—therapy is about fit more than anything; one who works well for me may not work well for you. There are also plenty who should have a different career, though—I know because I used to know one personally, and I worry about his future patients.  Honestly, the key is to not settle for someone who doesn’t help you, but also not get discouraged about how many different therapists it takes, or even how long it takes before your therapist helps you. Honestly, I’ve been seeing mine for 7 years now, the first 2 were probably mostly me trying to claw myself out of a lot of situational depression. I wasn’t able to do the real work until I had a different job + apartment away from my parents—i realized they’re both narcissists who are incapable of true unconditional love. A big realization I never could have had without my therapist, painful but healing. I am so grateful I stuck with it—even through the plateaus. Therapy can be incredibly uncomfortable, but it has been so rewarding IMHO! Lol sorry for the essay. I just got out of my session 😂  
What percent of therapists do you think are good therapists as opposed to the horror stories?  
I don’t think there’s any way of determining that because the stories are filtered through one person’s interpretation. Sometimes people say they hate a therapist because of transference or because they have not realized they have suffered trauma and are more guarded than they know. The horror stories tend to be full of details we can grab on to, and more people complain in reviews than compliment. The bad experiences are real, but I always worry a little that someone will be turned off when they could really benefit from going.

Of course they want to know. They want you to talk. You don’t have to carry your burden alone. You will meet new people who will be better friends and help you. Your not alone on your journey. You are stronger than the negative thoughts. You are strong for reaching out for help. Things will change when you least expect it.

Please hold on At your age I was going through the worst psychological pain, result of lots of ptsd that was starting to manifest as bpd.  Shitty parents shitty sibling shitty friends shitty teachers bullies abusive partner etc. I was lucky to have a therapist, though. And I’m SO grateful I didn’t kill myself.  It’s never been as bad as when I was 15-16.  So hold on, I promise it will be better

I want to echo this. I also had suicidal ideation at your age and i'm really glad that i got to experience everything i've been able to. I've gone through a lot of really negative things as an adult too, but the moments of joy, of learning new things, understanding more about why I was depressed, made life way better. I have another friend from high school who also had a lot of suicidal ideation as well. Now is super stable and happy, and one of the more solid humans I know.  In high school, you're stuck in a "box", so to speak. This may change quickly as the years go on. Or they may not., but after high school you have a lot more autonomy as to who you make friends with and who you focus in on. "Do these people I hang with help me? Are they contributing to my well being?" You can ask those questions later in life. You can ask those questions now and get ahead of things! You can learn to understand that you deserve those things 100% One more point, I'm 39 years old and just started seeing a therapist in 2018. I'm seeing a cognitive behavioral therapist and I've found it to be extremely helpful. Got me through one of the most difficult years of my life and taught me how to continue moving forward. This is after decades of severe depression. I survived a psych ward visit and many other things, but honestly, I feel way better now.  Just know that there is so much out there. The amount of knowledge you have now may be dwarfed by the amount of knowledge you may have in a few years or maybe more, maybe less. Remember, if all the negative stuff counts, all the positive stuff does too. Don't beat yourself up, or learn not to. Forgive yourself for backslides. Making mistakes is a part of learning. We're all a work in progress and if people don't recognize that, it's their problem, not yours.

Not saying anyone should kill themselves and I hope the OP is alright but I'm 21 and the transition to adulthood has been far worse than high school was. "It gets better" for a particular type of person who can get into/afford a good university right after high school and no one else.

My sister committed suicide two weeks ago. Please don’t put your family through what I am going through. I wasn’t even that close with my sister. We rarely talked, we hadn’t sat down and talked in person in probably ten years. We were on good terms, but we just had our own lives and didn’t talk much. So you might think, well, you weren’t that close so it shouldn’t hurt that much. Right?  I feel like I am drowning. I often just sit and stare at the wall for hours at a time, completely lost. I’m not eating. I’ve lost ten pounds in two weeks. I’m not sleeping. I slept about three hours last night.  It’s like someone threw me into the middle of the ocean with an anchor tied around my neck.  Suicide is permanent.  I watched an interview a while ago with a guy who attempted suicide by jumping off a bridge. He said that as soon as he jumped, he immediately regretted it. In the few seconds as he fell, unable to stop himself, he wished he had never jumped. He thought to himself, “No one will ever know.” He lived, and he has talked to hundreds of other people who have attempted suicide. He said every single person he talked to who had attempted suicide by jumping off bridge all said the same thing, “As soon as I jumped, I wished I could take it back.” I can’t tell you how horrible my life has been these past two weeks. Even people who barely knew her are hurting and crying. Her roommate who found her is a complete mess. They were good friends and spent a lot of time together. I know what it’s like to be depressed. I know that it sucks, and it’s awful, and it feels like things will never change. I’ve suffered from really bad clinical depression since I was about 12 years old. I’m 27 now, and I’ve found ways to live with it. I’m married, I have two beautiful daughters, and a wife who I love with all my heart. I contemplated suicide myself as a teenager. But again, it’s permanent. If I had gone through with it, I would have missed so many joys, so much goodness that has happened in my life, despite my struggles. Please don’t. You have no idea how much it hurts to lose someone to suicide. It didn’t even hurt this much when my dad left our family. It didn’t hurt this much when one of my best friends passed away unexpectedly from a heart attack. Suicide is different, and the pain is unimaginable. Please don’t.

I am sobbing reading this. I have a sister a year and a half older than me and let me tell you, my world would be absolutely destroyed if she was no longer in it. We’re close but even then I’ll tell you our relationship is nowhere near perfect. It’s not about whether or not your life or relationships are perfect, but the fact that you’d be forcing other against their will to live in a world without you and it’s so painful. We’re worth more to one another than you’ll ever know (and I don’t mean me and my sister, I mean everyone).  We grew up with a clinically depressed mother who always threatened to kill herself whenever any conflicts arose. Because of this we made a deal that we would never lean on this as an excuse or a “way out.” I know my mother struggles, and I don’t blame her for what she has to battle, but it was almost like living with suicide as if it were a person, sitting at the table with the three of us, threatening to flip everything upside down any second.  Suicide is never the answer. It’s never the solution, and it breaks every promise it says it will keep.

i don’t think they would want to know that their child is depressed and fucked up I am 100% positive that your family would love to know what’s going on, and would also love the opportunity to help you through this time. I’m saying this as a person watching their loved one battle a similar situation. Depression is a bitch, and it can swallow a person whole, but there’s help out there. Please reach out to your family and let them know what you’re going through. They will help you. You can, and will, overcome this.

I know you’re just trying to help, but it’s very possible that OP’s family is extremely abusive, and they just don’t know it yet. It wasn’t until I’d begun suffering from serious mental health issues that I began to see who really cared about me and who just wanted me around for their own personal benefit.

If this is the case, is there a good friend or trusted adult you could talk to? In an ideal world, no one would be stuck in a position where this would be case. Unfortunately, our world is far from ideal. Even if it’s not in person, try to call or Skype with someone else that you can trust.  Due to some issues I’ve had with my family in the past, I’m not completely comfortable talking to them about everything I’ve felt/been feeling either. At some of my lowest points, it has really helped to talk to someone outside of my family. In high school, those people were my music teacher and my best friend. In college, they were my applied lessons teacher (I majored in music) and a couple of friends I made in the music department. Recently, they were some coworkers that I’ve spent the last few years with and have gotten to know well.  Please know that you are not alone. Life can really suck and be unbearable, but it can and will get better with time.

Friends have definitely helped! At this point in my life, I’ve cut contact with almost everyone blood-related. Friends I’ve made who have helped me to get through some of the toughest times in my life are my true family. I wouldn’t be alive today without them.  There were times when I’ve basically forced myself to socialize and get to know new people, and some of those new people became that family.  I think OP needs to find some good friends—online or IRL (hasn’t made a difference for me)—who will aid in keeping them out of that dark place. They’ll have to wait until they’re a legal adult to have more options, because god knows CPS sucks ass at saving children from emotional abuse, so I can’t stress how important it is to have as many people on your side as possible.

It's completely okay to feel what you feel. You are wise to give yourself time. You are right, this is not how you want to exit this life. Give yourself more time. Teen years are overwhelming at best, irrational at worst. Hormones can really fuck with your perception. Seek daily meditation; this escape from your current reality could bring you so much peace, believe me, it's that powerful. Take care زين خاليل

You've completed 15% of your life. There is so much more good things you haven't seen and done. Give your loved ones a big hug and think about never feel that feeling again. And many more good feelings because you're just on 15%, there are so many good feelings you're going to discover. The road can be wobbly, but you will get the feeling and it will pay off. Feeling fucked up is temporarily, even when it are 2 years. 2 years are just 2%, you can survive this. I really so say this because of personal experience. I'm 22 now and still alive. And I love being alive right now. Don't give up on this wonderful opportunity living for 100 years. Advise from me: Think being a kid, what you did, what you liked, how you behave, what food you eat. And then give your loved ones a hug. Just say: can I give you a hug? Feel their love.  
UPDATE: i am going to kill myself today
Please just don't do it. Whatever issues you have can be dealt with. Talk to your family; they love you and will do anything for you, im sure. Teen years suck ass, but things do get better. If you need to talk we're here fr you

Childhood/early adolescent depression is real (dysthymia). I’m so glad to hear from you. I hope you’re able to get the help you need!  I’m glad you’re still here.  
UPDATE: i am going to kill myself today
Also, it's okay to have depression, even at your age. Depression, as you say, sees no numbers. It's not impossible to have it for two years. It's absolutely okay. It doesn't make you less human  
UPDATE: i am going to kill myself today
Please hold on for longer. Please do. You matter to your friends and family. Imagine them breaking down when they find you gone. Your mom, your dad, your friends, and even people you may not even expect, they all would love to hear your story rather than attending your funeral. I know it's hard out there. It's okay dear. Seek help. Talk to someone who you trust. I know you can. You're an amazing, worthwhile person. You deserve to live. Please, please hold on a little longer.

I don't need this, please don't  
I’m really curious what got you to this point. Do you have a suicide plan? What is it?  I’m willing to make a bet with you; I bet you if you got help it would be a huge wait of your shoulders. Things would be much better. Isn’t that what you want? How would you not want that? It’s right there, you just have to reach out.  I also bet it takes a couple weeks to a month to start feeling better and not suicidal. Why choose death when a better life is around the corner.  Hey, if you got help and overcome this, you’d have one hell of a story to tell of how you survived and fought your demons and fought for your life ...that you’ve been there done that ...and it builds character. Killing yourself doesn’t do that  Give help a chance. Give your life a chance. Give your parents a chance and a heads up on what’s wrong. You all deserve better.  
I don't need this, please don't  
How can you say for sure you don’t need this? Have you tried reaching out for therapy or medicine? Does your parents or family know of your pain? Getting help for me was immensely life saving/changing for the better  I’m so happy you reached out to reddit for help, that was a big positive step ...very admirable. I think you should try to reach out further.  What’s to lose reaching out? Nothing. Everything to gain. Be strong, be of good courage, and be a fighter for your life and get the attention and help you deserve - because your life matters and you deserve better  may I ask what is it that is making you depressed or suicidal? There has got to be a root issue that can be fixed or treated causing this  I and the folk of reddit would love to hear your story, your struggle, your life, and maybe we the people can help you together  Please, we all care and do not want you to do this ...your family and friends don’t want you to do this ...you don’t want to do this  Please please share your story with us and reach out for the help you deserve Keep breathing, love. Nobody wants you to die. I wish you well

Well maybe i need it but i can't talk to someone about this, opening up is harder than killing myself... Please don't do this

Opening up may be harder to do than killing yourself, but it’s also much better for you (and others), in the long run. And you’ll be so fucking glad you did. I sure was. Honestly, getting myself into counselling and therapy was scary and so not easy, but it was so fucking worth it.  
Well maybe i need it but i can't talk to someone about this, opening up is harder than killing myself... Please don't do this  
I respect your wish for me to back off. I wish to say one last thing. I can only imagine the pain you’re in. It sounds awful. When I was in pain it was incredibly hard to open up, but when I did... I didn’t know what I was so afraid of.  Being brave enough to open up and reaching out it better than being brave enough to kill oneself.  I know and can tell for a fact that your are brave enough to open up and get help. All in time. Take the time you need.  But please try to this route before you kill yourself. If it doesn’t work out at least you’ll know you tried every option for life before you died  If or when you ever feel the need to get stuff off your chest, people are here to listen and to help.  ...as you can tell by how many people came to your aid (which is quite uplifting) a lot of people care  Much love I send to you. I wish you the very best. Please take care of yourself. Peace and love  
Well maybe i need it but i can't talk to someone about this, opening up is harder than killing myself... Please don't do this  
Are you afraid of judgement? What if talking about it was the one thing that made it better? The fear of the unknown can be so, so much more powerful than doing the sharing and communicating. There are people who are trained to listen to the things that are so, so hard to say. They can help you. We are here for you. Please reach out  
UPDATE: i am going to kill myself today
Just wanted to add: I understand what it's like to be freaked out by thoughts and ideas that come to mind. Shit you would never want to express, even verbally or in writing for fear that people wouldn't understand, that they'd think you're a monster, that they'd demonize and hate you. I understand. We don't control thoughts that happen to us any more than we control twitches and aches in our body. Because if we actually controlled the thoughts, we would never have ones that we don't like, right?  We don't want to feel depressed, we don't want to feel fucked up. I don't think it's possible to force those feelings away. But we have a tendency, I think, to add onto it by believing that we're at fault for it, that we're terrible people for it. But if we recognize that we at least don't control it, we can at least start out by reducing the amount we beat ourselves up for the thoughts and feelings we have. I hope this helps, even slightly. Best of luck, my friend.

Trust me, your parents DO want to know how you are feeling. It is not crazy for you to be depressed at this age for as long as you have. There is help out there for you and I promise your parents would rather help you than to find you dead. Please give them a chance.  
UPDATE: i am going to kill myself today
I'm going to be honest. I have no idea if this is an update and you didn't do it. I hope that is the case. But don't do it otherwise. You're parents will miss you and if you're friends are great and love you, you'd be surprised about how many of them rely on you for a smile. I suggest telling your parents. I did, it was extremely difficult because it is a good family and I have no reason to be depressed. It worked out I go to therapy and am getting much better. Going through that stress of telling your parents is worth it  
UPDATE: i am going to kill myself today
There are so many good thoughts and encouragement already shared here, and I’d like to add my own bit of logic to it, cause who knows how you think, maybe you prefer rational reasoning to purely emotional stuff, so here goes: You say you have a normal, objectively good life, a loving family, good friends. So your environment is fine, which means the reason you feel the way you do is purely in your brain. That doesn’t mean it’s your fault, it’s nobody’s fault and I know, I really really know how much it sucks. But here’s the thing, there are people who can help you, there are medications that can help you and it is completely ok to use these recourses. Your brain is an organ, things can go wrong in it and adolescents is a time when so much is getting rewired it’s easy for something to not go quite as it should.  The good thing is this is something that can be helped by professionals. It’s not a huge mystery, they’ll know what to do, what to try, and if you communicate with them they’ll know what you need. They can get you on just the right medication to help your brain do it’s job right, and yes, that takes a while but if you let them, they’ll support you through it and it is unimaginably easier with help! Being a teenager is already hard, being a depressed teenager is....difficult to live through if you’re alone. I know this, I did it, I didn’t tell anyone. And even so it got better. Teenage brains can be fucked up, but they also change even on their own. Being depressed now even if it’s been going on for years doesn’t mean you’ll always be depressed. I would say though that it really is much easier if you accept help. Your family loves you, I’m absolutely certain they would help you if they knew. And I know they would want to know. Mine did, it hurt them more that I waited way too long to tell them. They weren’t angry, they didn’t tell me off, they respected my boundaries on what I was willing to share and they helped me get help. And I knew earlier that this would be their reaction, and yet my screwed up brain stopped me from telling. Don’t let yours srew you over as well. I know things can get better for you. Why not try? Why not wait just a little longer? Don’t let a couple misfiring neurons or out of wack neurotransmitters rule your life. You just need to take control for a little step. Just one. You just need to tell someone and ask for help. That’s it. I know it sounds like the most difficult thing in the world but it’s worth it. It. Can. Get. Better. No matter what your brain is telling you. It’s lying and/or just plain wrong.  Main point again cause this got long: your brain is an organ, things can go wrong with it, but it can also be healed with help and there are professionals who will know exactly what to do. You do not have to be in this alone and it will not be like this forever.

I’m glad, relieved that your still here. I’m not sure what to say to you that might change your mind. I’ve been where you are right now. It was a dark abyss that seemed impossible to climb out of. At some point I started to think about what a life of my own choosing would look like. The things that would distract me from the darkness of my racing thoughts. The possibility of falling in love, and being loved in return. All my hopes and dreams. I know now that I didn’t want to die as much as I couldn’t bear to live. I realized that I had a choice. I got through that time, and went on to marry and have a family, and now grandchildren.  I also lost someone close to suicide. I can tell you suicide is like a terrorists bomb. The closer you are the deeper the wounds. It is unimaginably painful. The consequences are endless to everyone who was close. But the one thing that stands out to me is that I would have done literally anything to help, we all would have. I’m sorry if it is unfair to bring that up, but you need to know. Our lives will never be the same, and that person will never leave our hearts. Our sorrow may lessen, but it will never end. It sounds like you have many people who care for you. Please reach out to someone. Share your pain. Find the help you need. All of us here truly care for you.  Most of us know how it feels to be surrounded by people who love us, and still feel completely alone. You’re not alone. It doesn’t matter that we’ve never met. We are bound together by the struggles we share. Many of us have been where you are now, and struggled with “do I stay or do I go?”. Please stay. I promise you that you will have peace and happiness as intense as the darkness you are feeling now.

I know it doesn’t seem like things will change but just give them a chance. I went through severe depression and anxiety when I was a teenager, I also suffered from something called OCD which gave me thoughts I didn’t want to think of. It doesn’t make you a bad person at all. I really hope you consider talking to your family or a therapist. Go seek help because there’s so much more to life if you give it time. Your family needs you and so do the peoples lives you’ll impact you don’t even know yet. Don’t give up on life. Have you tried kids help line? There’s a lot of resources now for people suffering through this. You don’t have to suffer alone believe me. If you would like to talk feel free to message me. You can and will get better if you give it time.

Saw your previous post and I am SO glad that you are still alive.  I know it's been two years which is such a long time, but you still have the chance to get help.  Tell your family and friends how you feel because I'm sure that they care about you and don't want you to do this.  
UPDATE: i am going to kill myself today
Please please please hold on and don’t do it. I would never downplay how horrendous depression can be and how it can send you to such dark and scary places. However, you will NOT feel this way for the rest of your life. You have so many people to meet, places to go, and things to accomplish moving forward. Even if you accomplish nothing your life is just as valuable as anyone’s and there are a multitude of people who want you here and want to help you. Even us “nice strangers” on here would be so sad and broken if you did this to yourself. Please talk to someone about this, even if you don’t know why you’re depressed there are people who can and want to help you figure it out and make it better step by step. Teenage years are some of the most difficult years of your life and your emotions are valid but ending your life is not the answer. Reach out, stay strong, even just survive the best way you can and we will be proud of you and here to boost you up ❤️  
UPDATE: i am going to kill myself today
please don’t. i’ve been there, i know how it feels. it took me some time but things can get better. believe me, your family wants to know and help you. please talk to them, and hold on if you can.  
UPDATE: i am going to kill myself today
I hear your pain. I felt the same around your age. I struggled a lot with my mental health 13-19. But I’m 20 now and I’m so happy that I didn’t succeed in killing myself at 15. It wasn’t easy, but it really does get better. Please reach out to an adult you trust so you can start getting help. You don’t need to suffer alone. You can’t fight this alone. It’s okay to reach out. I’ll be thinking about you op, I hope you get the help you need and stick around a little longer.

I’ve been suicidal before I even knew you can actually voluntarily leave this place. I must’ve been 8 or something. I literally was suicidal/depressed/self sabotaging up until 23. I’m SO GLAD I gave myself the opportunity to live and feel what I’m feeling now, as a 25 years old. Truth be told, I only stayed alive so my siblings aren’t traumatized for life, and my parents don’t live broken from what I’ve done. If only I’ve known whatever I’m going through had a deadline that was different from the one I wanted to have.

Friend, the thoughts you have in your mind are okay. They are scary and maybe shameful or guilt-inducing, but it is okay that you have them. Often with unexpected OCD symptoms people have socially unacceptable or scary thoughts or fantasies that cause tremendous pain and fear. It’s scary, I know, but you are not bad and you do not deserve to be punished, much less killed. You deserve relief from your pain, and it will come with time and with support. I know patience and relief feel impossible, but you’re already surviving very difficult circumstances. You are resilient. You have survived two years of depression. It’s so painful, I know, but you have survived it, and the more you survive the sooner relief will come. And it feels incredible, I promise you, and you deserve to feel that. If you need help figuring out what to say to your parents, folks here can offer ideas! If getting support from your parents is impossible or you worry they won’t be helpful, there are a lot of alternatives!  You are important, and what is going on in your mind sounds so difficult. So many people experience this. Many people have unexplainable fantasies or ideas in their minds that feel so scary. You are not alone, and there is relief. It will come, the more you reach out, just like you’re doing here. And feeling like the relief is impossible is a stop on the road to getting help.  Sending you an enormous hug.  
UPDATE: i am going to kill myself today
Sending you so much love, OP. You are so brave and strong. Please reach out to someone for help if you can. You are a badass for continuing to live every day.

Hey, I read a few of your posts. Anyone who intentionally leaves another person, no goodbye, when they know your hurting, isn't a friend. I suffered for months because after a friend left, I felt like everyone was gone. I see you, I see your pain. But this. This isn't the solution.

Hey. I had my first depression when I was 12, I’ve tried to kill myself so many times, harmed myself in so many ways. I also had a loving family, and great friends. I know how it feels. It’s terrible. Depression doesn’t discriminate.  In two weeks, I’m turning 27. Life is pretty good now. It does get better. But the first step to recovery is getting help. Tell someone. Please.

Hey! So, please don't. The question is not "Am I happy?" or "Have I ever been happy/" It's not even "Will I be happy?" Happiness is a place we visit, usually at random, for a brief time. The visits are longer and more frequent when we have meaning in our life. Meaning we create. My life at age 15 was school, home (not great), some friends (we mainly bonded over how shitty everything was), weed and alcohol. Not exactly a rich, fulfilled life. There is potential for your experience to change. In fact, I guarantee that your life will be different in a year, a month, a day. How it will be different no one can say, but it will not be the same. HIGH SCHOOL SUUUUUUUCKS!!!!! I would not go back for a million dollars; not kidding. And I am not rich. It has no relation to the rest of your life (I'm 51). Think of it as a test of endurance, if you can get through even the next six months with the depression you have, then you can repeat that until graduation. Then, enduring whatever pain you have will be easier, and it may also be less pain to endure. I am a psychologist who works with people your age, and I can continue this conversation in detail if you like (here or privately), but I promise there are ways to decrease your suffering and increase meaning in your life, today.

I lost someone close to me at 14 to suicide. I already had been depressed before that since 8 so didn’t help to add that. Not to mention your body and mind are changing due to hormones and just life!  Please hang in there, hold on. Ask for help. Potentially admit yourself into an inpatient therapy or house it WILL help. It helped me. I was in your spot thinking ending it would be better. Everyone has meaning and it will all make sense some day!

OP, if you kill yourself, they will know albeit too late and they would hate themselves for not being able to talk to you and help you through it.  I know these times are hard, depression sucks. But if there is ever any light on a rainy day, its because of our family and friends.  Dear OP, we all love you here. Just thinking about your death makes my heart heavy. So, instead of taking this week to say goodbye, maybe try talking to your parents or your friends, OP?  
UPDATE: i am going to kill myself today
I truly hope you decide to reach out and share that you are hurting with your family. For what it is worth, I've been in a similar place in my life, and it does get better. At age 15, I had attempted suicide 17 times. I began experiencing depression at age 9, and had been diagnosed with double depression (now known as persistent depressive disorder, with major depressive episodes, seasonal type). I was hospitalized at age 16 and never thought I'd live to see 20, and I'm about to turn 28. At this point in my life, I'm extremely grateful that I did not succeed in killing myself when I was younger and got the treatment that I did. It hurt to go through each day and you probably feel that leaving the world is better than staying, for yourself and others. I promise you, that is not true! Did my family/friends worry about me, yes, but that is because they care. You aren't fucked up because you have depression. It is something that can last for a long time, but that doesn't mean it can't be beat. It can be overcome and you can find your reasons for living. Please reach out to someone who can help you get professional help.  Us internet strangers may care and want to support you, but I can not undersell the importance of you sharing how you are feeling with those in your life. Feel free to DM me if you want to know more about what to expect from various treatment options and/or ways to share what you are going through with those you care about. I've gone through both of those many many times in my life and am happy to try and help you in any way I can.

I’ve been battling depression and suicidal ideation since I was 11. I put a revolver (Dad’s, not his fault was locked up, I was just sneaky). My brother jumped into a Niagara Falls 7 years ago this month. His last act made me feel a rollercoaster of emotions, but he saved my life. I’ve seen what it does to families first hand and know the guilt fear by the survivors so I’ve vowed never to do that to my loved ones.  That being said, the intrusive thoughts of thinking I’m worthless and that I should die never let up. They get more relentless when you realize you have control and tell them no. I’m now 34 and just recently had the largest breakthrough on my journey to better my mental health. It took hard work and determination but you too can live with this.  I just got out of a relationship and moved back home in another state. I self isolated in a hotel room for 5 days in order to limit the chance of potentially spreading Covid to my family. And I was TERRIFIED to be alone with just my thoughts. Because I’m the past, it led to drinking excessively and not being prepared for the onslaught of thoughts. Instead, I binged as much Jordan Peterson lectures as I could. And in it, I got the message I was looking for. A. I got the validation I needed that it’s not easy living with this sort of thing, and stopped feeling sorry for myself. B. I recognized that my immediate family members are the most valuable commodity I could have, so I’ve started to communicate far more effectively to allow everyone to understand one another better. My father has always seen Mental Illness as weakness because my mother always suffered from it. But now, as he’s gained insight through our conversations, he’s my biggest advocate. TL;DR Keep your head up. You’re not alone in your struggle, keep that in mind when you go really dark. Every thought that pops in your head isn’t necessarily a thought that is correct. Try to start a dialogue with your parents if you’re comfortable and they’re receptive. Therapy and medication can work wonders if utilized correctly for the short term.  
UPDATE: i am going to kill myself today
It is not about them and how they feel about your depression and sadness or happiness. It is not about them. It is about you. You deserve to be able to be OK. Just.. to be able to go through a damnday without wanting to hurt yourself or die. So tell somebody. Because there are people that have those days. And they can teach you how. Might as well give them a couple minutes? A year? You can always change your mind.  
UPDATE: i am going to kill myself today
There’s nothing quite like being a teenager.  It can be hard.  I think you might want to try asking for therapy, because even those with mostly normal lives can benefit from it.  At the very least, a good therapist might be able to give you some insight.  If your parents are put off by it, just let them know you feel like you’ve felt like you’ve been in a rut for a couple of years and you just want to sort out what’s going on with someone.  (Unless you feel comfortable enough to speak to your parents on your own?) I was in your shoes of feeling very depressed and suicidal back in 2014... not a day or year goes by that I’m so thankful to still be alive. :)  You can overcome this & I have faith that you will in time. 🤍  
UPDATE: i am going to kill myself today
I’m going to take a line from Sherlock. Your life is not your own. If you take it tomorrow it’s it you who is hurt, it’s everyone who cares about you. Is that what your goal is? I know it isn’t. Of course you don’t want to hurt them. You don’t want them to know about what you’ve been dealing with, but you seem okay with taking yourself out of their lives. People aren’t here to be happy, people are here to make each other happy, and sometimes we aren’t very happy doing it. That doesn’t mean it can’t change. Your family has been there for you as long as you have been alive, so don’t take all of that away from them. Talk to them. In 20 years when things are good and you’ve processed all of this stuff and they’re saying “I’m glad she told us about how she felt” do you think they’d rather be saying “I wish she never took her own life”?  
UPDATE: i am going to kill myself today
Please listen to everyone else here. Talk to your family. I guarantee they would so much rather you talk to them than have you hurt yourself and end your life. I have seen the devastation of families when their child or sibling dies.  I have been in therapy since I was a child and it is never too late. It has helped me immensely. You have so much life to live. Please talk to your family, or whatever you do, please ask for help.  
UPDATE: i am going to kill myself today
I’m so glad you didn’t go through with it! I will say that I thought I had a normal family at 15, when I was also suicidal. (I’m 28F, btw, and was suicidal for over a decade). It really wasn’t until I moved out and was in therapy as an adult that I learned that my “normal family” wasn’t actually normal, and my anxiety/depression were absolutely made worse by my narcissistic helicopter parents—still are. (They never beat or molested me, we had money, but they managed to fuck me up anyway via conditional love and constant criticism.)  This may not be you, but I do suggest being mindful when you are feeling at your lowest. For a long time, I had triggers I did not understand (eg receiving the silent treatment was a biggie, as my mother used to do it all the time and I never knew if she was upset with me or not.) It took me a very long time (and hard work) to understand how and why those things triggered me. In retrospect, I do wish I had had people point out super unhealthy aspects of my family dynamics—like my parents responding with anger just because I was expressing a negative emotion, or them showing so little interest in the things that were truly important to me. I couldn’t have known this at 15. We only know from experience. People who grow up severely abused often think it was normal, because it’s all they ever knew. I thought that, since my parents couldn’t comfort me, I was just a freak and nobody could. Turns out they just lack empathy, and I found an amazing boyfriend who does comfort me.  Again, I don’t know your parents, and perhaps they are wonderful people! I just know how oblivious I was at 15, not understanding why I was so anxious, depressed and terrified of failure. I also didn’t understand why I felt relief when my parents went out to dinner and left me home alone. Turns out, they were doing so much more damage to my psyche/self-esteem than I ever realized. Now as an adult, I am grieving the normal childhood I never had—grieving for the little girl inside me who was never allowed to be herself.  Good luck, OP. Even if you can’t see it, there IS a light at the end of the tunnel. Regardless of what’s happening to you, you’re not alone in this struggle 💚  
UPDATE: i am going to kill myself today
please don’t do it, It’s a permanent solution to a temporary problem. The people you know and love won’t be better off, they’ll be sad . You deserve to live, and to give yourself the chance to be happy, give yourself time to heal. Try and distract yourself, I know it’s hard but I doesn’t hurt to wait. This will pass, sometimes it returns, but everything will work out in the end. You can be happy and you will be happy. Please don’t go, it’s not worth missing out on all of life’s wonders.

I’ve had depression almost my entire life and I’m 30, but life is still worth living. My mom abandoned me for drugs, accused my dad of raping me so he lost custody. Ended up being raised by strangers who didn’t love me and disowned me when I came out. Had a 6 year long abusive relationship that resulted in 3 abortions. After leaving it I was homeless for several years. But life gets better a little bit every time I try to improve it. I live in a gorgeous house now. I’m almost done with my degree. I don’t have any toxic people in my life anymore. Do I still need therapy? Yes!  But life can always get better...unless you kill yourself. Then you are nothing. You have no hopes or dreams. You scar your family and friends and every time they think of you you cause them pain. And your life still isn’t better. Don’t kill yourself. It’s absolutely not worth it.

Just want to put this out there... This is exactly how I felt before I became a huge psychology buff and began researching things... and realized that many of my “family” and “friends” were actually extremely emotionally abusive, and I just didn’t know differently at the time, and it was severely affecting my mental health. In your shoes, I would look up “signs of emotional abuse” and see if there’s anything you can relate to.

You’re only 15! Trust me, things will get better for you , life will get better ! Please, please do not do anything to harm yourself. I know you feel that everything is hopeless, the world is a hopeless place but trust me on this one - it’ll get better.  I’m not sure where you’re based but consider talking to a helpline - Samaritans or going to your GP or nearest hospital or A&E .

I’ve been where you are. I first contemplated suicide at age 12. I very nearly killed myself two years ago.  I’ve also been where your family might be if you go through with it. My closest friend in the world died by suicide. It’s the hardest thing I have ever been through in my life. And I’m an amputee, I’ve discovered my husband had a secret life; I’ve been through some shit. But losing my best friend that way? As soon as I heard the news, I started screaming uncontrollably and couldn’t stop. Please don’t do this. Please don’t.  You deserve better. You don’t deserve to go through this completely alone. Please open up to someone, please allow someone close to you the opportunity to be there for you, to help. I’d give literally anything to have one more chance to help my friend, to have known what he was going through before it was too late. Please, please give someone that gift. Let someone help you. Let yourself be helped. There’s no shame in getting help. Everyone has dark times and bad thoughts. Don’t just try to bottle them up! Getting them out helps to exorcise them, to rid your mind of them. Just bottling them up lets them fester into self-loathing.  I wish you all the best. Please, hold on and get help. hugs

I’m glad you’re still here OP. I understand the overwhelming feeling those thoughts can have, as do many here Reddit. It’s not easy to overcome but it is possible to get there. Please give yourself more time. I wish my brother and friends had given themselves more time. Reach out to someone you trust. Tell them what you’re going through. They will try to find you help. There are people out there who are trained and who want to help you. Pleas give them and yourself a chance.  Death is not the only solution. There’s a book I read years ago that helped me through a dark time “It’s Kind of a Funny Story” by Ned Vizzini. Maybe it will help you too❤️

There is treatment for depression. You said that you have a loving family. So go talk to them. Talk to your parents. Tell them that you have been depressed for 2 years and you think about suicide. Go to your family dr and start some antidepressants. They really can help. And then find a good therapist who can give you strategies on how to manage this.  Please don’t take your life. There is a way out of it. I’ve been severely depressed for the last 20 years. I’ve been suicidal. I’ve attempted many times. But the right medication and therapy has lifted me from the deep depression.  Hang in there mate.  Oh and if you don’t want to talk to your parents, is there anyone at school you can talk to?  
UPDATE: i am going to kill myself today
Just think for a second, about how you don’t want to burden your family with your current pain.  Then, and I know this is really hard, but try, step away from your thoughts and conclusions for a bit. Imagine your mother and father and maybe siblings. Imagine them finding your body, or learning of your death.  Maybe you think that it will be hard on them, but they will get over it. Maybe you think that you are such a toxic presence that it will be better for them in the long run. I know I had those kinds of thoughts, every time I wanted to die, Those thoughts are fiction, part of what you are struggling with. Your continued life is a requirement for your family. They love you, they need you. They need you to not be dead. They don’t need you to be healthy or even nice. Just not dead.  And let me tell you that you are a goddamn hero. You are struggling and fighting and trying to be a person, and it hurts all the time. And you are trying to do it in secret, when all this time it’s like a biting shadow on your soul. I’m guessing, anyways. It was for me. As someone who is still healing (at a later age, because I’m not as smart as you are and didn’t know myself then) I can tell you for a fact that there is therapeutical help, there is pharmaceutical help, there is spiritual help. There are people who urgently want to help you. That can help you.  Don’t be shy. It’s so tempting to be shy, and believe the distorted thoughts that tell you that you aren’t worth anyone’s time. You are worth it. You are a hero.  You want to talk? I’ll send you my number. Need help getting started with a therapist? I’ll research people in your area, walk you through insurance if you have it and help out if you don’t. Want to rehearse talking to your mom? I’ll help with that to. Just don’t die. I’m a mom. It would end my life if my child died, especially if she killed herself. That would probably do it for me.  Don’t die.

I said this on your last post but I’m going to be a little bolder this time - please get help. Have you tried to do that? It is not worth killing yourself if you haven’t tried to reach out for help and fight deeper for life. How can you kill yourself with a clean conscience knowing you didn’t give help a chance or yourself more chances for life and to make things better? How?  So you say you have a nice family, how can you do this to them? The pain you’ll cause them will be immense. Please don’t  Getting help was the best decision I made and saved my life. Therapy and antidepressants have helped and they can and will help you too. Please reach out and take care of yourself

Ayy man, trust me, I know exactly what your going through, I’m not gonna sit here and say everything is gonna be okay and be all cliché. I’m 19 and I’ve had depression since 16 in high school, and just last night just like you I had those voices in my head running wild out of my control. I don’t have a solution or cure for depression. But I know sure as hell that this isn’t the one. You have too many great memories around the corner. Happiness will come your way I promise. I keep battling my demons as long as you do.

Just so you know, most people fall in depression in their teenagehood. I was depressed as a teenager as well. It started in a young age, I don't even remember because I didn't know what depression as a concept is. But I do remember I was depressed, I cried every night but I smiled in front of everyone else. You're not the only one, and this is normal but talking it out would help, if your parents are educated they will really understand and support you. Mine were/still don't believe that mental illness is an actual thing. Stay strong, this is all gonna pass and you will be just fine. Just remember that the happy chemical is never released by itself, you always gotta make effort to make yourself feel better and or happy

I am so fucking happy to be reading this. You matter, please reach out to your family. And, i don’t know where you are but in California parents don’t need to consent to mental health treatment for those who are 12+. I hope you find some light. Thank you so much for the update.  
Ok. It sounds like you are depressed. (Sorry if that is a ridiculous understatement.) How are your current circumstances? Are you safe, sheltered and fed? I just want to get the basics out of the way.  
No immediate environmental factors that I know of, just psychological. I struggle with mental illness. Bipolar disorder and severe anxiety are most prevalent.

Dawg, imma just summarise what I want to say to you with this: "Just hang on", seriously. May sound stereotypical or something but really I'm not a professional at this kind of situation but just hang on. Ain't there shit you want to do with your life? Be it something big like make yourself rich and famous or even something small like go to Japan or get your own car. Simple goals like those are the types of things that you need to keep in mind because all those experiences you would have? Gone. All of its gone cos your pain at the moment is too much for you to bare and you want it to stop. Your friends and family all wish that you achieve those dreams and if you just worked up the courage to tell them, to explain to them your problems I'm fucking positive they'll help, if they truly love you they will. I really didn't want to make something too long but I can't just summarise the different aspects of life that'll just be gone from your grasp cos you decide to end it all, to stop writing and give up halfway through the book that is your life. I'm not gonna say these feelings are due to teen hormones or something cos although that may be the case I'm not a professional of any form and can't give you that idea unless that's what I believe to be true but what I do know is that there are people out there who want you to be happy, be it your family, friends, teachers or even the dipshits who've commented on your Reddit posts, trying to talk you down because when it comes down to it the majority of Humans all care about eachother and want the best for eachother. That includes you, we all want you to be happy and I'm sure if just you telling us your story has made us go out of our way to help you then I'm damn sure that if you just reach out to the people you know they will help you shoulder the burden or solve your problems because they want you to be happy as I and all the other people here do. Edit: one last note, if you can't work up the courage to tell family members of your situation then just message your mum or dad links to your Reddit post, as whilst it may be a bit I dunno... Insincere I guess is the word it's a lot easier than typing out a whole thing or even worse, speaking directly to them because goddamn do I know how hard it can be to open up to others but I'm sure ctrl c and ctrl v is a lot shorter to do and as such is less of a time to back out of it because you need to seek out others for help because suicide is never the way out.

As the mother of a child who completed suicide I can honestly from the bottom of my heart tell you that your loved ones would rather deal with a fucked up depressed child (as you say) than a dead one. Reach out and take the hands that want to help you. We are all fucked up. That is what makes life entertaining. I have always said normal is just a term someone came up with to make everyone else feel bad about themselves.  If you are that sad please have yourself committed to a psychiatric hospital. There is NOTHING wrong with helping yourself get to a better place again. If medication is what makes you feel okay in this world then take it!  I personally feel that everyone could use a little something. When people tell me I’m crazy I tell them the only difference between us is I have been diagnosed and they are undiagnosed.  I would not be here if it was not for extremely high does of antidepressants. I was put on them after I lost my son and I will be on them for the rest of my life because they help keep my mind focused on all the things I still have to do in this world before I can leave.  Please just think about how important you are and how dark and terrible the world will continue to become if we keep losing beautiful people to Suicide.  Find what works for you to get your smile back. I promise there is something out there even when you feel like nothing will work.  I know this because I have lived it.

You are not alone. We all care about you. Your family and friends care about you. You deserve to find happiness! The only way that can happen is if you stay. I know it might seem impossible that you can get better, but trust me, you can! I survived a suicide attempt a few years ago, and I'm glad that I survived. Things got better. I learned how to handle things in a healthier way and got the help I needed. I used to not want help because I thought it was a waste of time. It wasn't! Therapy and/or other treatments could help you too!  Please stay and see how much better it can be once you start getting help. If you don't feel comfortable telling your family, any doctor or teacher can also provide you with resources to help!  You are so strong, you've made it this far! Please keep living. 💜 You are loved, and deserve a chance to get better and be happy. Just because you are experiencing this doesn't mean that you're the problem, it's not you!! You aren't fucked up. It isn't your fault. It requires attention and treatment just like any physical wound. You are important, and so is your mental health! It may help right now to make a list of the little things in life that you find beautiful; anything that makes you laugh; and people, places, and things that you like being around. Keep going over those things in your mind and try to use them as reasons to stay, at least until you have access to treatment! 💜

You need to know what makes you depressed and resolve it, talk with loved ones.

Each and every one of us has the choice to live or to die by our own accord. That is power. Ask yourself, why do you not want to live? Why would want to live if you chose to everyday? That is a good place to start. I almost killed myself in 2017 and have been suicidal for years. So the day after I decided to try to start committing daily to life I decided to live it differently because I was not sure which day would be my last. I started living for only what I want. Living is hard. But the right thing for me to do. Seek someone that can sit with you in this moment please. You need someone at your side. I hope you choose to live. We need you, i love you

please consider that at 15 your hormones play a lot of tricks on you. Everything can feel really intense and permanent. It's not. Why not give yourself time to see what post-adolescent you feels like?  I've recently gone through this with a kid your age. It was absolute hell for a while there but he agreed to give it a chance. 1 ½ years later he's doing so much better and while he's still working on social anxiety he's really far from the suicidal thoughts he was stuck in. He's like a different person.  Please take some time and read about the effect that hormones have on your body and your mind. It's like having mosquito bites when you're sunburned. That shit feels like hell on earth and it's all you can think about but once it's gone it seems like it was a million years ago. The intensity will end and then you will be able to handle the things we all do. Will you give it a shot?

Hold on buddy. Though it might seem a million miles away, with the right help and resources, things can get better. The best thing to do right now is just to talk. Be it to your family, to a counsellor, to one of the numbers listed below, just talking about things will help. Just writing your thoughts in a journal can be therapeutic.  If you're in the US right now, you can call this number to talk to a counsellor: 800-273-8255. In the UK, call 116 123 to speak to the Samaritans. For other countries, the website here has a list of the numbers you can call in your country: http://suicidestop.com/call_a_hotline.html Regarding the ideas you mentioned having, remember that you are not your thoughts.  "intrusive thoughts — unwanted and distressing ideas that feel contrary to a person's nature. They often cause intense anxiety and stress."  I don't know if you are experiencing these, but from what you said it sounds similar to something experienced in those with obsessive compulsive disorder. OCD can involve the recurring presence of 'fucked up', 'morally wrong' thoughts that keep coming back, over and over, in a way that is incredibly distressing to the sufferer. Having experienced this myself, I too thought there was something incredibly wrong with my mind, until I realised it was OCD. It's a horrible thing to have to go through, but things do improve. The link below has some information on OCD, which can hopefully lead you on the path to recovery if you find you have similar symptoms.  https://www.madeofmillions.com/ocd/intrusive-thoughts Feel free to message me if you'd like to talk more about OCD, or even if you need someone to talk to in general. I'd be very happy to talk through things, or even just listen if that's all that's needed.  https://www.madeofmillions.com/conditions/major-depression There is so much love out there for you buddy, be it with your family, friends, all the people on this thread who've shown up to support you.  It's okay to not be okay, just hold on in there. Though it seems like they won't at the moment, things can get better.

Hate to break it to you, but that's an empty promise, and phrases like that can actually make a person feel even more isolated.  There are no guarantees in life, and making statements promising that things will get better tells the person that you have no idea how they're feeling and that you're willing to lie to them to avoid the anxiety you feel in response to their sadness.

Thank you so much for not going through with it. It’ll get better. I went through something similar and I’d say the best way to treat it is to get help and talk to your family about it. Having people that can support you is a big help.

Nah, man, you're not a jerk. Good for her that she throws out shit like that but it helps nobody. I used to be in the "positivity is not even an option"-group and hated this stuff with all my heart. Now I'm able to be optimistic a good 9/10 days and nothing about this stuff being phony, unhelpful and at worst, guilt-trippy, has changed.  You're not a jerk, her posts are shallow.

I have a friend whi I met after an overdose in a program - she cried every single day in the program but I learned she is much like me and does not cry around other people. She brings them up and gives smiles and hugs and love. She makes me smile with her positive smile and and be happy posts. I have seen that girl on her knees begging to die. I don't care if that is what she has to do all day... post that shit all she wants, I an going to frown if I want to.

Yeah exactly sometimes people post this positive shit because they are having an absolutely shitty day and shit has happened in their life and they post the positive tripe as a reminder for themselves, not directed at anyone else.  Beautiful influencers are people too, with their own problems. I know a couple of “beautiful influencers” whose lives “look” perfect and they get sad and insecure just like anyone else.

Even during my most positive days I never felt the want to preach it to others.  It just feels smarmy and disingenuous.  Generally, when I feel good I’m pretty quiet about it. But you will know that I’m good with life by my contentment.

It doesn't make you a jerk at all. Instagram is not real. She will have just as many problems as other people. Sounds like you're triggered by other people's happiness (even if it seems completely fake and probably is in this case). Well me too. You're not a jerk and neither am I. Use this as a tool to work on yourself. You will probably figure out eventually that this is just her way of dealing with her own insecurities. Turn that finger around lol and take control otherwise you will be forever at the mercy of an infinite array or pretentious stupidity (lol see I have more work to do...)

You don't need to be sorry for feeling that way. Pretty sure that wveryome has felt loke that at some point. It's just that not all have the courage to acknowledge it to themselves, and even fewet to talk about it. So be proud of yourself for talking about it! :) Just don't grow fond of feeling this way. I can tell you from experience: You don't want to grow fond of feeling like that.

I think it’s absolutely useless advice that’s typically peddled by self-promoters. I’ve been in therapy for my anxiety for a few years and the whole “choose to be positive today!” advice is counter productive. There are many more useful approaches.

It may be frustrating because it is invalidating your own experience.  It's like a parent telling a child they are not angry, they have no reason to be angry, and they are just being a spoiled child when the child is feeling angry about something.  It hits at the core of feeling un-valued and rejected and you have good reason to feel the way you do in reaction to the posts, even if the other person has good intentions.

I fully agree. People who just tell you to feel a specific way and then get mad that you dont feel that way can get fucked  
This makes a jerk, I know, but those posts of “be happy stay positive!!” really tick me off
Yes it useless garbage but stop letting it trigger you. Those people are not going to stop or change so you must change and stop reacting to it. Give it no space in your thoughts, just recognize it for the garbage it is and move on. This in itself is one of life's greatest battles.  
This makes a jerk, I know, but those posts of “be happy stay positive!!” really tick me off
Gotta remember: when people post those sorts of things, they're not necessarily trying to convince you to stay positive, they're perhaps trying to convince themselves, whether they know it or not. Sometimes we need to be "negative", I think. Sometimes we need to be angry and upset and anxious. They're perfectly natural feelings. And I find those feelings sort of dissipate more naturally when we notice them, allow them, accept them. When we try not to think of it as, "oh no, I'm being negative! What's wrong with me?! I need to be positive!" and more so as, "Huh, I'm feeling negative and not so great right now. Well, okay." And if that's difficult to do, allow it to feel difficult as well. And if that's difficult, allow that. And so on.  
This makes a jerk, I know, but those posts of “be happy stay positive!!” really tick me off
Definitely agree that toxic positivity is awful and super harmful. I do think positivity or at least gratitude are important practices though. Toxic positivity says ignore your problems and choose happiness. Boxing up the dark parts and shoving them down. A glittery bandaid over festering wounds. I believe what I’ll call mindful positivity is the necessary partner to experiencing the harder emotions. Mindful positivity prioritizes self-compassion and self-awareness. Instead of forcing “everything’s great!” It’s actively bringing your attention to ‘better’ things. Not dismissing what you feel, but also allowing space for hope or gratitude. My journey (and mission) is learning this and sharing what I learn when I can.

It's fine if someone wants to that that to themselves -- but saying it to other people is condescending. To me it means, "your problems aren't that bad and all you need to do is pretend."  
This makes a jerk, I know, but those posts of “be happy stay positive!!” really tick me off
Applying positive thinking over wounds is like painting over rust, it eventually peels off, so it does not work.   There are good looking people who are severely traumatized and suffer terribly.  And there are plain looking people who had great childhoods and rise to the top in life, often acquiring good looking spouses, and achieving great careers.  Good looking women are resented by other women, and by the men who are intimidated by face value.    I have known ordinary looking people with great charisma, and who were more attractive than conventionally good looking people.

If you like podcasts you should check out The Happiness Lab. The episode “Don’t accentuate the positive” talks about how positive thinking alone doesn’t work. Made me feel better about having the same feelings about the “just stay positive” bullshit you see everywhere and might do the same for you.

Cognitive psychologists believe that depression and anxiety are a result of a cycle of negative self-talk and a negative view of the world. If that's true, then being positive in as many ways as you can can only be beneficial. It not as easy as turning a switch on like these people suggest but it is the very bottom line of cognitive behavior therapy.

Therapist here. It's a lot more complicated than that. Also there are a lot of other types of therapies out there (like humanistic) therapies that take a different approach. Personally, as a therapist, I find that avoidance of negative emotions is one of the biggest issues clients have. Ironically, it's what gets people stuck in the negative cycles.

Things you should know when talking to a therapist about suicide
Hi, Id like to add a little to this (but I think it’s pretty comprehensive already!) I’m a therapist and I’ve been doing crisis assessments for 5 years.  1- There are two types of “getting sent to the hospital.” First, you can be sent to a regular hospital emergency department, or the intake of a psychiatric hospital, for an assessment. The assessor there is usually someone who is specifically trained and talks about suicide all day every day (that’s what I do).  This is different than being admitted to a psychiatric unit. I send plenty of patients home from the emergency department after we get to chat. I recommend admission to the secure unit only if I can’t be convinced that the patient can be safe outside. That is literally the criteria I use: “do I think this person is going to die tomorrow if they go home today?” 2- many therapists and counselors don’t have this specific training and experience around suicide risk assessments. So they might send you to the ER so someone who is more qualified can make sure you’re OK. It’s not a punishment - it’s them trying to make sure you’re not in danger. It’s definitely an inconvenience for you, yes. But it’s kind of like if you went to your dentist and said you were having chest pain - that’s not your dentist’s expertise, so he’s going to send you to a cardiologist. If you’re not at risk, you should be sent home.  3- when I assess someone, I look for plan, means, intent, impulse control, ability to safety plan, and reasons to live. There are people out there who have suicidal thoughts with a plan every single day, but 99.99% of the time they have zero INTENT. If you have intent to die by suicide, I will probably recommend your admission. But if you only have thoughts and means, I’d ask you to restrict access to means (have someone keep your gun at their house, have your spouse lock up your meds, etc). If you have a lot of reasons to keep living, then I’ll make sure we highlight those in our safety plan.  4- Safety planning: safety planning is an important part of the risk assessment. If someone wants to go home, but they can’t tell me any reasons to stay alive, or identify any coping skills, or identify any social supports ... it worries me that they may be rushing home to hurt themselves, or that if they face a crisis in the next few days they won’t be able to stay safe. If someone is high risk, but they have lots of social support, are willing to let friends/family restrict access to lethal means, are willing to follow up with outpatient providers, can identify coping skills, and have demonstrated some impulse control, I would strongly consider sending them home. 5- nobody likes being hospitalized but sometimes it really is the only way to stay alive. And if you need someone else to be in charge of your safety for a few days when things get really dark, there’s no shame in that.  6- if you have a lot of suicidal thoughts, you should ask your therapist - before you become an ongoing client - how they handle “baseline SI.” If they are uncomfortable with that question, they won’t be a good fit for you. If they talk about having a safety plan in place from the start, and are able to clearly articulate to you what the criteria is for breaking confidentiality, they probably know what they’re doing.  7- criteria vary by state. Some states are “imminent danger” and some are “substantial danger” - meaning various degrees of risk of suicide - while others use “grave disability” which is a much lower bar. Ask your therapist.  Hope this was helpful!

But not if there's no current danger.  Like if you are an adult and report being abused as a child, the therapist should ask if you want to report.  But is not obligated to make a report.   Also "duty to warn" if you make a credible threat toward another person, that you intend to hurt/kill them.

Me being sent to the hospital was exactly what I was worried when I talked about suicidal thought to my therapist. Good thing I was able to just pucker up and have that conversation about what would help me the most mentally, and ended healthier and not in the hospital!  
Things you should know when talking to a therapist about suicide
I've had a few clients report suicidal ideation but able and willing to contract for safety, I still remember the one client expressing it as "background noise," I documented it however I never felt it was necessary to have him go into a crisis center or psych hospital in response to the things he shared during a session, he was able to contract for safety.  Bigger concern is when a client indicates plan and intent. Also having a history of suicidal attempts are a notable red flag when assessing for safety.  
Things you should know when talking to a therapist about suicide
Counsellors are supposed to explain their limits to confidentiality to you in their opening discussion, when you contract and what have you. It can depend on what ethical body they are registered with. Here in the UK a popular one is the BACP. And their limits to confidentiality are harm to yourself or other, money laundering and drug trafficking. When contracting and explaining this I have always initiated a short discussion or given an explanation around harm to self or others stating that it is ok to talk about suicidal thoughts and feelings and if I were to sense or my client were to disclose actual intent of harm then i would discuss this with them further and i would never break confidentiality before discussing it with them first.  I have been in a situation where i have felt the need to remind someone of those limits to confidentiality and just make sure that they know where the line is, making sure they knew that if they were to go further with a topic that they were wandering in to an area i would have to disclose. The last thing i want is for someone to forget and say something they didn't mean to and for me to have to act on it. I'm not trying to catch people out  but if they want help and want me to be the one to disclose and start that help process then I'm good with that. Its about transparency for me. I've also been on the receiving end where I needed to talk about a person that i knew had sexually abused some young girls a long time ago and now had a daughter of their own. I did not believe this child to be in danger and i was not in a position to act on the info i had for many different reasons.... but had to be careful in my discussions in therapy to not make it obligatory that my counsellor do so. Ethics. They can be tricky.

So when will they send you to the hospital? How much can I honestly say? I have a strong skepticism of my therapist and tell them I never have thoughts. I don't trust them  
So when will they send you to the hospital? How much can I honestly say? I have a strong skepticism of my therapist and tell them I never have thoughts. I don't trust them  
You can ask your therapist this and not say anything if you like. That’s totally your choice. A hospital admission would be considered if; suicidal thoughts are so frequent it’s taking over your life, you can’t see anything good changing, having plans and means to end your life, feeling unsafe at home and not able to access support/friends/family or feel safe with therapy alone.  Hospital should always be a last resort just to keep you safe.  While you do have thoughts and plans, you have kept yourself safe so that is a huge strength in itself. edit: also wanted to add that often therapists do things like ‘safety plans’ (you can actually do these yourself and get them of the internet or use an app). Basically you write down things you can do when feeling suicidal and unsafe, people you can call and other techniques to fall back on. If people weren’t willing to do these (or engage in therapy at all) it might be a little alarm too.  Sorry this is a long post! Again, tell your therapist :)

"What coping skills do you have?" Where is your safe zone, a safe place you are not under duress." These questions. And more.  I did not have good responses. Yet I walked out of the office, drove home, and back into the cycles of depression, anxiety, and more. Sad to feel so sad.

This is so helpful, thank you. I had a counsellor when I was a teenager and the main thing they emphasized was that the police would immediately get involved if they thought I was going to harm myself or anyone else. They didn't explain it very well and made me feel as though I disclosed any self-harm that I'd get taken away. They also only focussed on my grades and what I would be doing with my education so I stopped going after three sessions.

So far the best therapist I have ever had is my college counselor. At our first appointment she asked about my experience with therapist's and I told her all the things that I hate and right there in the room she made a vocal and thought out plan to avoid the things I hate. So now she gets all the information I tell her, remembers details from our last conversations, she asks questions to get more details and that's it. She doesn't give advice about something unless I ask for it, she doesn't offer any judgment unless I tell her my side and when she does offer judgement it's always just validation of my point. And she's free through my school so I can tell that she doesn't care about what I could give her money wise-she doesn't benefit from having more appointments. She just cares about helping me get better

How severe would it have to be to get sent to the mental hospital?  
I was initially going to post this but wasn't sure if it's industry standard but from my experience, I didn't even have severe suicidal thoughts but my therapist said I can't see her anymore, please go to a hospital/psychiatric ward.  All I said was that I have thoughts of not wanting to live anymore but I don't think of ANY plans of going through with it. Moreover, I specifically said that I have control over these suicidal thoughts and can reverse them right away. She thought about what I said over a week and at the next session, she told me to not see her anymore -- please get help from a hospital, psychiatric ward, or a psychologist. Maybe it's a one-off event but that's partially why I don't mention my suicidal thoughts, however brief, to therapists anymore. I know mine last maybe 1 minute 1 time a month, and I can stop it! but my therapists might not understand it's not that severe for me. Like, I have gone through enough depression that right now, I don't even want to give up no matter how hard things get. Even if I am wildly depressed one day, I just go to bed knowing I'll feel better in the morning and try again. I'm desperate to live life on the other side, and so even if something triggers a suicidal thought, I have control over it. I wish my therapists understood that. But I get that if any therapist hears of suicidal thoughts, they might just suggest mental hospitals or emergency care right away. They don't know what to do to help you besides sending you to professional medical care.

Oh no I’m so sorry for your experience.  I feel frustrated that your therapist not only didn’t help, but shoved you off to other resources. I promise you that what you experienced is not the norm.  There will be other therapists who can understand it and take you seriously.  People who are trained in suicidality know that it’s a spectrum, and you’ve clearly got that inner resource to ‘reverse’ your thoughts which is not an easy thing to do!

There will be other therapists who can understand it and take you seriously.

It's not the norm?! Oh man, that therapist seriously convinced me that it was the norm :x I felt bad for even bringing it up because I was paying to see her and it was our first 2 sessions... and it was hard for me to even find a suitable therapist!  Thanks for this! I thought it was a standard procedure to shove me away or something.

No not at all, I’m sorry - this isn’t your fault!  There will be a therapist out there who is glad that you brought it up no matter how long you’ve seen them.  
I was initially going to post this but wasn't sure if it's industry standard but from my experience, I didn't even have severe suicidal thoughts but my therapist said I can't see her anymore, please go to a hospital/psychiatric ward.  All I said was that I have thoughts of not wanting to live anymore but I don't think of ANY plans of going through with it. Moreover, I specifically said that I have control over these suicidal thoughts and can reverse them right away. She thought about what I said over a week and at the next session, she told me to not see her anymore -- please get help from a hospital, psychiatric ward, or a psychologist. Maybe it's a one-off event but that's partially why I don't mention my suicidal thoughts, however brief, to therapists anymore. I know mine last maybe 1 minute 1 time a month, and I can stop it! but my therapists might not understand it's not that severe for me. Like, I have gone through enough depression that right now, I don't even want to give up no matter how hard things get. Even if I am wildly depressed one day, I just go to bed knowing I'll feel better in the morning and try again. I'm desperate to live life on the other side, and so even if something triggers a suicidal thought, I have control over it. I wish my therapists understood that. But I get that if any therapist hears of suicidal thoughts, they might just suggest mental hospitals or emergency care right away. They don't know what to do to help you besides sending you to professional medical care.  
Oh cause I'm scared to go there. I've hidden many things from the counselor at my school just so I don't have to go to that place. Where I live the hospital is in bad shape and I hear many horror stories.

Ohhh I'm assuming it's high school counselor? I'm in college so I'm not sure how it works for high school but because the students are under 18, whatever the counselor says really might be more powerful than your decision. Maybe someone else will know this better than I do :x If you voice suicidal thoughts to a school counselor, I'm assuming the counselor reaches out to your parents first and will potentially suggest further medical care like a mental hospital :o oh man :x those places can be more scarring than helpful. My friend told me about how she walked herself into the ER before and she had a relatively OK experience but then there are definitely places that are traumatizing D:  I'm hoping things get better for you!!!

College counsellor.. I'm 20 Lol  but my family don't have to get involved that's not their business... The most I'd allow is having my significant other involved. I haven't talked to her in a while but want to soon  
How severe would it have to be to get sent to the mental hospital?  
If you say you have a plan - you’ll be put on at least a 72 hold... and it’s not fun and you don’t learn anything - they basically babysit you and some other very mentally unstable people. I’ve been in a psych ward and jail & I much rather go to jail.

I am happy I could give you that much, this is hard, it is a very difficult thing that isn't so well understood and I am happy that I could give you that. This group really has helped me recently, I hope it helps you too if you are not already in it: r/EstrangedAdultChild  
I feel like most people think I'm lying or crazy when I try to explain the situation. I haven't been validated by anyone but my boyfriend.

Yeah I've experienced this as well, it hurts a lot. My partner is the only one that is really there for me too for this, it is incredibly alienating. It has severely impacted my ability to connect with people. I try to tell my crazy story and it sounds more psychotic than a Jerry Springer/WWE/Jersey Shore/Trailer Park Boys/ summer slam special. Now that I think about it, that might of been why I was thrown on anti-psychotics, the story itself is an incoherent clusterfuck. I am so grateful for the stability I have now, it took years to earn it but I finally have something resembling peace and quiet.  
Awesome reply.  
Thank you!  
Great response!  
Thank you!  
My mother was a narcissist. I cut contact four years ago. Today I was told she's dead.
There are two things I would recommend.  If your sister is normally trustworthy, then believe her. Second I would continue to look for obituaries once a day.  If you feel like you are going to compulsively look, ask a friend to do it for you.  If she was a member of a church, you could call them and ask (I would call on a google voice number in case someone gives out your number). You can also check her social media pages. It is totally normal to feel conflicted about news like this. Either way, it seems your relationship is over and may bring up feeling of relief, sadness, grief or numbness (to give a few examples). It’s okay to feel however you want and it’s okay to be confused.

You should think of the best possible version of you, then understand that you already are that version, then just cut off every part of you that doesn’t believe it

This is exactly what I was trying to find a gentler way to say. Blunt is typically not my style when it comes to these types of things but I appreciate the ability. I was going to recommend a pro and con list because they have helped me a lot. But if OP’s mom is like those on r/RaisedByNarcissists (a sub I recommend too) then imo it’s not worth the risk. And, really, what is to be gained by contacting the people you previously decided to cut out of your life?

I'm apart of that sub as well. They're a huge part of the reason why I went NC with her. They offered so much support.

Are you still in contact with your sister? If so, text her to find out whether it’s real or not

No, I blocked her when she attacked me shortly after I went no contact with my mother.

It’s okay to have all these feelings resurfacing. She’s inflicted trauma on you, so it’s all stored in your subconscious still. But you do NOT owe her anything, or need to open lines of communication just because she may or may not be sick or dead. I would definitely recommend a good trauma informed therapist (not all therapists are created equal, you might have to search a while to find one that clicks with you), so that you can heal from the wounds she caused you. Because otherwise those wounds will still be with you and still come out sideways in different types of ways. And you don’t want her to have that power over you. You deserve to be free of the pain she caused you!!

Yes. She encouraged my mother to "let me fall on my ass" after my dad died and I was struggling with surviving, heading towards the worst depression in my life. Their main concern was that I wouldn't look for a second job to make more money.

Then i would say dont listen to it and also block your sis. Just my personal opinion, knowing how siblings can be just as bad if not worse than NParent when helping them

Shes been blocked. She messaged my friends.

Oh I’m sorry. Just have them block her and ask them not to communicate things she shares with them anymore. You sound on top of things; you’ll get through this.  When things are out of my control I try to tune it out and overpower whatever negative things are going on with deep breaths and guided meditation audios. (Not sure if that’s helpful but hopefully doesn’t come off as dismissive.)

You have every right not to contact them or let them contact you. TOTALLY ok. If you’re worried you might regret not going to the  funeral or something...that’s something you’ll have to decide for yourself.  But what other people want and what we think society thinks is right doesn’t matter at all.

I’m sorry you’re going through this. It must be awful. I also have a narcissist mother so I can relate to that side but this is awful regardless of the the outcome.

What value did your mother bring to your relationship? Likely little to none. It was likely all about her. It’s ok for you to remove toxic relationships form your life.  It’s also ok to feel relieved.

I’m still in contact with both my narc parents. I imagine when they die, it will feel incredibly confusing. I do love them, despite them being the most manipulative, emotionally stunted people I know. Relief will undoubtably be part of it. They’re currently trying to coerce me into moving out of my apartment in NYC In the middle of a pandemic, while I am staying out of state and have no car. At least this is the wake up call I needed to become financially independent. I’m done with them using money to control me, particularly when it goes against all reason.  Don’t feel bad for feeling positive emotions about this. Narcs know how to bleed us dry emotionally. I haven’t been able to eat all week, adopted kittens yesterday, and all they care about is money they don’t even need. We’ve never done anything to deserve this shit.

We surely did not! I hate the "she gave you life" arguement. Okay? And? She gave me life then used to to fill some void she had, or abused me because she doesn't know how to function properly. Family. Does. Not. Equal. Obligation.

There are 2 possibilities here.  1) It's true.  2) It's not, and your sister and mom are just trying to guilt you into responding, since just simply saying she had cancer didn't work. Honestly, I would grieve as though #1 was true, regardless. Even if she's not and is just fishing for a response, she would be dead to me anyway. Grieve the mother you didn't but SHOULD have had. It's okay to have big, conflicting feelings regarding the death of someone who caused you so much pain. You're not a terrible person for feeling relieved. You're not weak. These feelings don't mean you regret going no contact with her. Be gentle with yourself. I'm glad you have a therapy appointment. It should help you work through these feelings. Hang in there, OP. 💗

I told my boyfriend that's what I was gonna do. Act as if she was dead. I feel that's the best option at this point.

Sounds like you're right to not trust it. I'd wait it out to see if more information comes up. Or just say fuck it, you've already cut contact and you might not even go to a funeral anyway.  Either way, I think it's totally normal to feel confused when an estranged parent dies. I hadn't heard from my dad for a few years and then got a call that he had died. I felt incredibly lost. Like, I had spent so much of my life trying to get his attention and approval, and then had recently shifted to just trying to forget and put it behind me. If anything, I felt relief that it was over yet guilt because I wasn't all that sad about it. Anyway, best of luck to you. I'm sorry that you have to go through this. Sounds like you have a decent support system with your boyfriend and friends. Lean on that.

You left your mother more than three years ago. She was never a appropriate social role model and caretaker as a mother. So psychologically you left her. You will go through a reaction if not generally for the loss of her at the loss of a mother figure.  
My mother was a narcissist. I cut contact four years ago. Today I was told she's dead.
Have a funeral. Grieve her like she's dead. It doesn't matter if it's true. Burn something you have of hers or that reminds you of her. Get rid of all the crap in your head that she put there...say it outloud or write it down (burn it). Also, thank her for something...anything she gave you...a sense of humor, etc. Keep that, the few good things & let the rest go.

My therapist just told me “and you’re probably going to have to deal with this the rest of your life,” and it was the hardest thing she’s ever told me.
I’m a psychologist and one of the analogies I use with anxiety is that, when teaching the brain to stay out of those anxious ruts, it’s like driving a stick shift - you have to understand how things work, when to change gears, and how not to roll backwards when things get challenging. If you practice though, eventually the new road become the rut and, most of the time, you’ll be driving an automatic on cruise control. You’re still driving but it’s much easier and requires far less thought.  Keep up the practice!

It's not about avoiding the anxiety, it's about training your mind to deal with it.  My therapist recommended organized anxiety. I take an hour a day and write down all my anxious thoughts.  It's taken practice and at first my brain didn't stop being anxious all day and I would plan what to write about the next day. The first week was horrible. But now, after doing it for a month, my brain is getting used to it and I can go all day after writing without anxious thoughts. Some days are still bad and I do slip up.   But I have many more good days than bad days now.  I know it won't work for everyone, but organized anxiety has helped me take my life back.

Avoiding anxiety only creates more anxiety :( Only way is to accept it If you try to avoid something, you're training your brain to have stronger emotional reactions to the something. It's very counter intuitive

And sometimes ya just gotta put the hammer down and let her run WOT! In a safe and controlled manner, while obeying all traffic signs and signals and wearing your seatbelt, and looking both ways, and coming to a full complete stop before progressing through the stop sign....and checking your blind spots! Lol...just went with it. But seriously, sometimes I goose the throttle for a bit of a burnout every now and then. Or mash the pedal for a mad dash to the speed limit.  As for OP’s post...specifically about your mind wandering off without you noticing...🙋🏻‍♂️. I’ve tried to get my therapist to understand that I can’t control it. I can reel it in once I do notice that my mind has drifted away. But that drifting away...usually happens about 10-12 seconds after focusing on something. Not sure if it’s dissociating or what? Since I do that too.

As someone who is rounding year 4 of therapy for anxiety that is very similar to yours I can say that the transmission example is spot on. It’s so much better for me now. The funny thing is that it’s so gradual that I don’t notice it. Stick with it and keep putting the work in. You’ll get there.

Isn't this similar to re-conditioning your brain? So now instead of unhealthy avoidance strategies that you're used to implementing, your brain adopts healthier ways to channel or confront the anxiety?  
My therapist just told me “and you’re probably going to have to deal with this the rest of your life,” and it was the hardest thing she’s ever told me.
My T says he often has to temper the expectations of his patients because they expect therapy to “cure” them. I’m assuming this is what your T was doing.  Medication is also not a cure. It is only a treatment.

I am not a therapist. However, I am here to tell you there is hope. Mostly reformed negative nancy here. I say mostly reformed because I still have to manage my anxiety. It isn't gone, but it is a hell of a lot easier to deal with now and happens much less frequently. I also have tools to soothe anxiety. I've learned how to put it down or allow anxiety to fuel me into action. I don't want anxiety gone, because it can be an alert to something that needs my attention. I just don't want it to overwhelm me, suck any enjoyment I have out of life, or paralyze me (mentally, emotionally, etc).  What you are doing now is retraining your brain and attempting to change your go to thoughts. I think the key word to focus on here is the qualifier word "probably". Probably isn't an absolute and could easily be replaced with "might". You might be dealing with this the rest of your life. Okay, but to what extent? Will it always take this much energy? Probably not. I think that is much easier to mentally swallow and accept. It may not come as quickly as you'd like. But keep at it because you're worth it. Be patient with yourself, because you deserve that.  I wonder if your therapist was attempting to manage your expectations of being fixed and completely (?) free of it. Anxiety in and of itself isn't "bad", it's when it becomes excessive that it needs to be addressed (which you are doing). Perhaps ask your therapist to elaborate. Could this get easier over time?

Anxiety in and of itself isn't "bad", it's when it becomes excessive that it needs to be addressed (which you are doing). Perhaps ask your therapist to elaborate. Could this get easier over time?  
I have been discussing this with my therapist, specifically how my anxieties do usually bring up good points, something I need to pay attention to in my life, and also how although it is a negative thought cycle the anxiety did eventually motivate me to action, which can be a good thing. The way  I’m currently dealing with it is to identify the thoughts brought on by anxiety, then to quiet/ignore them, but also to take note of what my anxieties are being brought on by so I can address them at the appropriate time.  For example, during exercise/meditation anxious thoughts will rush into my mind concerning an unfinished errand. With practice I can notice the harsh anxious “tone” the thoughts have and do my best to change my train of thought, but I will also make a mental note to address that errand later in the day.

This is fantastic! You are learning some great tools to manage this. I always think it's great when people recognize an issue and decide to do something about it.  After rereading my post, I realized the message that motivated me to respond in the first place likely got lost in my rambling. It is this, hearing that can certainly be disheartening. But keep hope, it may be that you deal with this for the rest of your life, but it is likely that it will get easier to do so.  This may or may not be helpful, but I have found micro routines to be incredibly useful in managing anxiety. They have relieved a tremendous about of stress. Constantly coming up with plans to get things done was zapping my mental energy and taking away precious time to work on things that really matter.  
My therapist just told me “and you’re probably going to have to deal with this the rest of your life,” and it was the hardest thing she’s ever told me.
Sounds like you've been working hard on it and have a pretty good awareness. Anything is possible. Keep it up!

There is definitely hope out there and techniques you can learn and utilise so the come naturally to help manage daily anxiety.  But I think saying you will have this forever is setting you up for failure. Whilst there may be some truth to it, I don't feel it is a helpful statement and it is something I'd want to explore with your therapist the next session. If you don't feel you can verbalise it, maybe trying writing it down and giving it to them.  Rather I think saying something validating like yes, you are really struggling with anxiety now, and its hard but there are techniques which you can learn which can help you deal with anxiety so that it doesnt affect you so severely. I will be here to help you navigate this and together we can work on making this manageable and far less debilitating. Your anxiety might not go 100%, but there is a good chance that by working on techniques together that it will make it manageable the majority of the time.  Medication, if you are open to that idea, can definitely help especially in.the short term while you ate learning these new skills.  I hope all goes well, I find anxiety so misunderstood by the general public.

I'm sorry. I've had this same realization. It can be so hard to live with knowing that really, it's going to be there forever.  But I've found that I don't have to think of my illness as life-damning. I think of it more as something I have to practice at. Some people have anger issues, some people are sort of disorganized, some people are really terrible at remembering birthdays. We all have to figure out ways to adjust to the world and help ourselves with the things we find challenging. I just have to be a little more involved than the mentally well because my illness impacts my life much more deeply than, say, forgetting my moms birthday. If that makes sense?

Have you heard/read about Cognitive Behavioral Therapy? It gears to change your thought pattern - engage in more “pleasant” activities and I stead of going getting sucked by “downward mood spirals” you try to be in “upward mood spirals.” This has really helped me because I too get stuck/paralyzed by over analyzing, etc, too many thing to list, it may be only for depression but I think you can apply it more broadly. (I am not a therapist though!)

i think thats a realistic and honest thing for ur T to say. IMO anyone that has mental health concerns that surround stress management, anxiety, depression, and emotional regulation are dealing with things they will continue to need to work at for the rest of their lives.  Think of it like someone who has an addiction (not saying u are addicted to anything) they will continuously work at not using whatever they are addicted to, for life. Or another example is maintaining a healthy diet/lifestyle. All of these things take a lifetime of constant effort...that's not to say that over time it won't become a positive habit thus making things easier.  So ur T is accurate in that sense but look at it like 1 day it's not going to feel like ur dealing with it but rather something u have under control or better managed.

I had social anxiety disorder for YEARS (most of my childhood and my teen years) and it could be paralyzing. Similar to what you described, I couldn’t do anything social without thinking the worst was going to happen and people were going to negatively judge me. CBT majorly helped me. You think about all the options and alternatives for what could happen and how likely, realistically, each scenario is. It really helps in realizing that the worst isn’t likely to happen, and if it does, you can work through it.

Seriously? Hire a new one. There is hope and help available. These things go into remission if we do our homework/ treat it  
My therapist just told me “and you’re probably going to have to deal with this the rest of your life,” and it was the hardest thing she’s ever told me.
The hard part is she is probably right. The good part is, you can do something about it. You still have control over your life and the power to make positive change. It may not go away completely ever but you'll become a master at coping with it so that it has less and less of a hold over your life over time  
My therapist just told me “and you’re probably going to have to deal with this the rest of your life,” and it was the hardest thing she’s ever told me.
I had something like that said to me about my rumination about past and hypothetical conflicts with my family. And I am still pissed about it if I remember the situation. I think it's like saying to someone with chronic pain "duh, it's chronic! Nothing will cure it, don't even think of it!" when a person already suspects it and is just looking for ways to manage the condition and have a good quality of life.  
My therapist just told me “and you’re probably going to have to deal with this the rest of your life,” and it was the hardest thing she’s ever told me.
Allow me to add an optimistic note.  You can turn your thoughts into action. Thoughts, as difficult as they are, have a valid place... they are a pathway between feelings and actions. The outcome of thought can be goal oriented action.  If you do something as a result of your thoughts you are now back in feeling and data collecting mode. Trying something new? How is it going? Are you getting closer to your goal? Thoughts are not supposed to be the goal.If you are stuck in no win thinking you get depressed. Understanding is usually not enough to bring about positive change, you need action. So OP, the next time you start down the rabbit trail, make a small step forward. Small is often enough to break the bondage of circular thinking.  You can be free.

Psychedelics can cure you and if not they will make you far far better than before research them it’s well worth it  Make sure you know what your getting in to a lot of research and reading what other people experience is essential

I hope you can try with someone else. There are many factors that go into not just a match but a therapeutic relationship. Maybe they have difficulty beyond what you know. I have gone through this but not to the point of termination. Professionally and ethically, unless you have violated some previously mutually agreed upon terms, they should have a session in which there is closure with recommendations for your continued care. Do yourself justice by persevering and learning how to heal. Don’t let this setback define your path. It doesn’t even if it hurts.

I mean she just doesn’t respond when I try to make an appointment, even though I’ve been seeing her since I was a child. My psychiatrist is the one who will have to contact her now for my file and that can be shared with my new therapist. I have quiet bpd and I am generally not very open so maybe that’s why she ghosted me. I don’t know. I don’t even think I feel bad about it

Not sure if this question belongs here, but I know someone (in person) who is claiming to others to be a therapist (this person is an older undergraduate student...) I am not sure if they had provided 'treatment' to anyone yet and charged (although something along the lines was mentioned passively in a conversation once). Does something like this get reported ? If so, to whom - the University they're attending? This person HAS worked in a medical setting before so is familiar with insurance billing procedures

It is illegal for someone to identify as being a therapist without being officially licensed by an overseeing body (Health Department or other licensing board). If you are concerned, I would encourage you to contact your state’s health department where you ca voice your concern. From there, they can look up the individual (also, most states have free databases on their department of health webpages that you can access to look this person up yourself). If, the individual is not licensed, the Department of Health will investigate. I’d encourage you to try the above, ad maybe, if necessary, get more information about the situation (seems like you have some pieces, but not all). However, if the person is an undergraduate I find it VERY unlikely this is true. They may want to be a therapist, but not understand the larger consequences of their actions.

This really doesn't surprise me. There are so many people in the UK who claim to be 'therapists' or 'psychologists' after having done an 8 day counselling course. It's heartbreaking that the general public are so unaware of the accreditations and registrations you have to hold to be able to call yourself either of those and as a result I see countless people in therapy who have come to have damage rectified by someone they saw previously who was not properly qualified. I'm half way through a PhD in psychology with a masters and an undergraduate under my belt- to put things in context I can only call myself a 'trainee psychologist' and I still have to hold the correct accreditations and registrations to be able to practice. So frustrating and exasperating.

I'm from India, I'm not certified, many call me a con- man, and over the years through my curiosity I read deep into different therapies, jungian psychoanalysis, Buddhist meditations and yoga, the journey began basically to heal a very close family member from schizophrenia. He is absolutely normal now(uses minimum dosage of psychiatric drugs) and over the last two years I've been helping different people heal trauma and different issues. I'm not against psychiatric drugs or other treatments,  but I strongly believe in a wholistic approach of combining different methods to suit the patient. And not for debating which method is the best.

Yeah she's what I'd call a 'regular therapist' not some highly specialized professional or psychiatrist. I've been going to my therapist for almost 2 years and a LOT of what we've talked about has been daily life issues because I've had a lot of current stress but I also had brought up that I had an abusive childhood from the beginning so we've been trying to get there but current life events have been taking more immediate priority.  I think it also helps frame the areas where triggers are clearly happening repeatedly and then we can go into the history for those triggers.  But I'm aware this is going to be a long journey and had put it off for too long thinking I could understand and self-help myself through it all alone. That certainly has been helpful, but there's only so much I can do myself.  I have asked about EMDR therapy but my therapist isn't trained in it so I'd have to work with someone else if I go down that route, which is fine,  I figure that's going to take a while to prepare for too, but hopefully I can get somewhere with this on the meantime.  I definitely feel like there are times that I'm just venting which is okay,  but doesn't feel like it solves much so I guess you have to advocate a little for what you want out of it and find the right therapist.  I'm not even sure if my therapist is the right one, but she's good enough for now at least so I'm happy to stay with her and try this avenue.

I was having the same problem. Then I found a therapist that practices traditional psychotherapy not CBT. I found CBT to be extremely on the surface and left sessions feeling like I talked about what the therapist wanted me to talk about, not at all what I needed to heal.

I couldn't recommend psychotherapy enough for most long-term conditions, especially those rooted in trauma.

I felt similarly when seeing the first therapist I saw as an adult. I had ppa and ppd after the birth of my child, and she helped with those worries and issues, but when we got to trauma, my relationships with my family members, and my childhood, her methods weren’t right for me anymore. I started seeing someone who specializes in trauma, and am having a much more productive time of it now.

U sound like u are having a hard time trusting your therapist. I get it bc reading posts of this group and other have me concluded that therapy has a long way to go before someone can fully commit to the healing process. If u cant open up then ask friend family or someone u trust for preferal

I had essentially the same experience. My therapist specializes in trauma too and we did some inner child work and one session I noticed her eyes get kinda big, and the next session she was clearly horrified (beyond her normal affirmation of my emotions). In the inner child work she asked me to imagine my dad comforting and asked me how it felt. And I told her it felt icky, and I hate him too much to include him in that part of my inner child work because it plays into his narcissism and makes me angry. So after that I started ranting about random memories of him being an asshole, that I felt were just examples of him being an asshole, not particularly horrifying.... and she was so shocked and basically told me— that’s really bad. Because my father didn’t beat me everyday or sexually abuse me, or do some of the classic examples of abuse I see on here, sometimes it’s hard to wrap my mind around how horrible he is. He was 100% emotionally neglectful, he had a horrifying temper that still scares/upsets me think about to this day (he is 6’2” and muscular, so that just compounds the terror of his rage), he just has no humanity and is a pure narcissist (possibly malignant, according to my therapist). And it’s hard to remember, just because my abuse might not have been the worst and he never stuck my hand to a stove burner, that doesn’t mean my abuse wasn’t bad and it doesn’t mean my abuse wasn’t abuse. Since I felt like I was just ranting about him being an asshole, since I thought it was basically about what a fucked in person he is rather than him directly abusing me, I was surprised by her reaction. And her reacting to what I felt was mundane made me start to question how I understand what happened to me. If that made her recoil in horror....  It’s also weird because his actions often don’t look like what you think of “normal” abuse, like what gets described here, but they were definitely abusive.... it was sort of extreme emotional neglect with a tinge of terrifying angry asshole-ism, and pure narcissism to boot. And also just weird-ness. I mentioned before how weird he is about death. And he gets “sentimental” despite literally never bothering to take pictures of us as kids and barely knowing our ages (one time he started writing captions on the backs of old photos and wrote my sister’s and my “ages” on the back of one, but the ages were six years apart and were 4.5 years apart....). He’s so weird!! And that has been a thorn in my side my entire life. Sorry to rant about me. But anyway, I hear you. It happens. And it’s confusing as hell.

Are we long lost siblings?!  Sorry you experienced this stuff too. It's tough to acknowledge on some levels how harmful the abuse is, I too often just file it into the asshole category for simplicity. But it's straight up, fucked up, abuse and torment.

Because my father didn’t beat me everyday or sexually abuse me, or do some of the classic examples of abuse I see on here, sometimes it’s hard to wrap my mind around how horrible he is. He was 100% emotionally neglectful, he had a horrifying temper that still scares/upsets me think about to this day (he is 6’2” and muscular, so that just compounds the terror of his rage), he just has no humanity and is a pure narcissist (possibly malignant, according to my therapist). And it’s hard to remember, just because my abuse might not have been the worst and he never stuck my hand to a stove burner, that doesn’t mean my abuse wasn’t bad and it doesn’t mean my abuse wasn’t abuse. Since I felt like I was just ranting about him being an asshole, since I thought it was basically about what a fucked in person he is rather than him directly abusing me, I was surprised by her reaction. And her reacting to what I felt was mundane made me start to question how I understand what happened to me. If that made her recoil in horror....  It’s also weird because his actions often don’t look like what you think of “normal” abuse, like what gets described here, but they were definitely abusive.... it was sort of extreme emotional neglect with a tinge of terrifying angry asshole-ism, and pure narcissism to boot. And also just weird-ness. I mentioned before how weird he is about death. And he gets “sentimental” despite literally never bothering to take pictures of us as kids and barely knowing our ages (one time he started writing captions on the backs of old photos and wrote my sister’s and my “ages” on the back of one, but the ages were six years apart and were 4.5 years apart....). He’s so weird!! And that has been a thorn in my side my entire life. Sorry to rant about me. But anyway, I hear you. It happens. And it’s confusing as hell.  
 Because my father didn’t beat me everyday or sexually abuse me, or do some of the classic examples of abuse I see on here, sometimes it’s hard to wrap my mind around how horrible he is. He was 100% emotionally neglectful  Oh yeah, I strongly connect to this. I always assumed - "My childhood was great - because my parents didn't physically abuse me, mentally make threats, or never fought with each other. Everything was normal - my parents were physically affectionate and pampered me on may birthdays. That means, either we just couldn't connect, or something's wrong with me." Turned out the emotional neglect was so huge, to the point of being shocking when my therapist heard about it. I suddenly began to remember when I did stayed over at a friends' place, their relationship with their parents felt so different. Like a two-way street. My parents were often sentimental, but it was a one-way street. Like I had to look after their emotional needs and not the other way round. I had to run around and "manage" their needs - often calm them down when upset, do chores around the house (more than my share) so they feel in control, or reduced my interactions with friends because they worried and felt insecure too much about me "leaving the nest". Finally it began to make sense.

Therapists are people too.

sounds like those tears validated your trauma in a way that you have not been able to hold. It guided you deeper into the work you were doing around child wounding. Tears that allowed you to witness how your inner child experiences that validation and the witness of someone else's pain. Therapists are human. If the session did not become about the therapist and their emotional response, and progressed your work and understanding of your narrative... sounds like it was still good therapy work imo.  
Made therapist cry
Honestly, I see this as a good thing. She probably knows you well enough by now to understand what kind of reactions, or even self disclosure, will be beneficial to the therapeutic relationship. Don't worry about her, don't feel bad, but maybe tell her what seeing her reaction did you to. It could lead to a very productive conversation next time.  And as a follow up to talking to her about what it did to you...The fact that seeing her get teary led to you feeling that childlike hurt, means that you have the chance to well and truly sift through those feelings and process them like you haven't been able to before. (IF YOU FEEL SAFE TO DO SO AND HAVE THE COPING SKILLS IN PLACE). She's there to feel the feelings with you and to help you walk through and out of the complicated narrative you have been dealt. Take your time - take care of yourself.

Hey, wow. I have no platitudes for you. Just something practical. If I were you, I'd talk to my therapist about how you experienced that session. That you weren't prepared for that reaction to your story. That the therapist's reaction made you feel something you weren't prepared to feel. That your reaction conjured up a memory and a mention of what you shared about what you'd like your father to do. ​ You're really good at explaining things -- I think your therapist can hear these things and move forward from there. Good luck. Your therapist is a human like you, and perhaps your therapist's inner child was astounded at what not all children experience.

The first time I ever went to a therapist he cried. I wouldn't say it was the only reason I never came back but it was one of them. It took me 3 years to make myself find another one. It made me feel like there's something REALLY wrong with me lol. It felt like pity and I didn't like that. But I can see how it could be good for other people. It could feel validating and that the person is truly understood. In the end it's about finding the right person for you and if you feel like you're getting along and he's helping you that's what matters.  It's one of my favourite dark jokes now. "I made a therapist cry". Some of the reactions to that are very amusing.

Yeah, I would have been very put off if it was the first session when there's a lot of feeling the person out so sharing feels more transactional to give a framework. And each person has their own right to appreciate or be bothered by the reaction, it's not cookie cutter. For me it was fine that she teared up, and appropriate for a person to feel sad or something at an injustice, I didn't feel like she was stealing my experience or making it about herself.  It just threw me in a way that made me feel things more viscerally than I usually try to because I try not to feel that pain for obvious reasons, but... that's why I'm in therapy,  it's no longer a useful coping mechanism to block it out. It's weird. It's validating, it's darkly amusing, it's triggering, and it's depressing to say "I made my therapistr cry" by sharing my childhood experiences.

Yeah I'd probably feel differently if my therapist teared up now after 5 months of me knowing him. And I can see how it makes it hard to block out stuff. When my therapist validates my feelings it makes them more real. Harder to ignore. Like I can't tell myself it's not that bad and that I'm over exaggerating and that people have it way worse than me.  Maybe that's what made me so uncomfortable about the tears. It made it real and I wasn't ready for it.  
Made therapist cry
That's happened to me, but it was a nice lady from my church. 😭  She asked why my father was in prison, I gave a broad answer, and she just broke.  I have definitely been more mindful of how I talk about my experiences to people. 🤷‍♀️

Sounds like you would benefit from  a therapist who specializes in trauma.

I've been doing a lot of trauma research lately and reading up on CPTSD. EMDR therapy seems to have the highest success rate of current methods. So that's a future thing to figure out, how to get that started and plan for that journey while also living my every day life... and not letting myself avoid the difficult things.  I wish I could put everything on hold,  take a life sabbatical and just de into this stuff,  like at a camp or something amazing and then hit the play button on the rest of my life. (What, it doesn't work that way? Rats!)

The good thing about EMDR is that the results with many are much quicker than conventional methods and the number of therapy sessions can be shorter term due to the effectiveness of the technique. It can be more expensive, as the training is expensive for therapists, and therefore the price of therapy is effected.

If you don't mind me asking what was the incident? I also think I normalise things that are really quite screwed up and it's sometimes helpful to hear other people's stories for perspective. Like I only realised in my mid-20s having a constant background hum of suicidal ideation isn't normal.   Also in terms of recovery r/mdmatherapy has been a godsend for me in untangling complex trauma (on the off chance it helps you too).

I'm struggling to respond without too much detail,  as it's the internet...  Severe emotional abuse, manipulations, gaslighting, being witness to violence against my mom over a conflict centered around me. Having no personal autonomy, emotional safety, no space for different wants or needs counter to my parents. Clothing being thrown away and not replaced.  Being abandoned suddenly at 11 and having my things sold off, being told it was no longer worth the custody/whatever struggles with my mom.

I’m sorry that’s awful and more than anyone should have to suffer. Thank you for sharing

Hi honey, you are going to be just fine. Everything is temporary, especially this feeling, even though it may feel never-ending. Ride the wave. You said it yourself, you don't want to do something as silly as hurting yourself when you can be kind to yourself instead. How would you talk to your best friend if they told you this? What about a little sibling, or even a stranger? You can handle the pain, because this is as bad as it gets and you're still here. Push through. Talk to someone. You are not alone. The comments under your post are just a small part of the proof that people care. Breathe.

If you are feeling suicidal now, please stop long enough to read this. It will only take about five minutes. I do not want to talk you out of your bad feelings. I am not a therapist or other mental health professional -only someone who knows what it is like to be in pain. I don’t know who you are, or why you are reading this page. I only know that for the moment, you’re reading it, and that is good. I can assume that you are here because you are troubled and considering ending your life. If it were possible, I would prefer to be there with you at this moment, to sit with you and talk, face to face and heart to heart. But since that is not possible, we will have to make do with this. I have known a lot of people who have wanted to kill themselves, so I have some small idea of what you might be feeling. I know that you might not be up to reading a long book, so I am going to keep this short. While we are together here for the next five minutes, I have five simple, practical things I would like to share with you. I won’t argue with you about whether you should kill yourself. But I assume that if you are thinking about it, you feel pretty bad. Well, you’re still reading, and that’s very good. I’d like to ask you to stay with me for the rest of this page. I hope it means that you’re at least a tiny bit unsure, somewhere deep inside, about whether or not you really will end your life. Often people feel that, even in the deepest darkness of despair. Being unsure about dying is okay and normal. The fact that you are still alive at this minute means you are still a little bit unsure. It means that even while you want to die, at the same time some part of you still wants to live. So let’s hang on to that, and keep going for a few more minutes. Start by considering this statement: “Suicide is not chosen; it happens when pain exceeds resources for coping with pain.” That’s all it’s about. You are not a bad person, or crazy, or weak, or flawed, because you feel suicidal. It doesn’t even mean that you really want to die - it only means that you have more pain than you can cope with right now. If I start piling weights on your shoulders, you will eventually collapse if I add enough weights... no matter how much you want to remain standing. Willpower has nothing to do with it. Of course you would cheer yourself up, if you could. Don’t accept it if someone tells you, “that’s not enough to be suicidal about.” There are many kinds of pain that may lead to suicide. Whether or not the pain is bearable may differ from person to person. What might be bearable to someone else, may not be bearable to you. The point at which the pain becomes unbearable depends on what kinds of coping resources you have. Individuals vary greatly in their capacity to withstand pain. When pain exceeds pain-coping resources, suicidal feelings are the result. Suicide is neither wrong nor right; it is not a defect of character; it is morally neutral. It is simply an imbalance of pain versus coping resources. You can survive suicidal feelings if you do either of two things: (1) find a way to reduce your pain, or (2) find a way to increase your coping resources. Both are possible. Now I want to tell you five things to think about.  You need to hear that people do get through this -- even people who feel as badly as you are feeling now. Statistically, there is a very good chance that you are going to live. I hope that this information gives you some sense of hope. Give yourself some distance. Say to yourself, “I will wait 24 hours before I do anything.” Or a week. Remember that feelings and actions are two different things - just because you feel like killing yourself, doesn’t mean that you have to actually do it right this minute. Put some distance between your suicidal feelings and suicidal action. Even if it’s just 24 hours. You have already done it for 5 minutes, just by reading this page. You can do it for another 5 minutes by continuing to read this page. Keep going, and realize that while you still feel suicidal, you are not, at this moment, acting on it. That is very encouraging to me, and I hope it is to you. People often turn to suicide because they are seeking relief from pain. Remember that relief is a feeling. And you have to be alive to feel it. You will not feel the relief you so desperately seek, if you are dead. Some people will react badly to your suicidal feelings, either because they are frightened, or angry; they may actually increase your pain instead of helping you, despite their intentions, by saying or doing thoughtless things. You have to understand that their bad reactions are about their fears, not about you.  But there are people out there who can be with you in this horrible time, and will not judge you, or argue with you, or send you to a hospital, or try to talk you out of how badly you feel. They will simply care for you. Find one of them. Now. Use your 24 hours, or your week, and tell someone what’s going on with you. It is okay to ask for help. Try:  Send an anonymous e-mail to The Samaritans * Call 1-800-SUICIDE in the U.S. * Teenagers, call Covenant House NineLine, 1-800-999-9999 * Look in the front of your phone book for a crisis line * Call a psychotherapist * Carefully choose a friend or a minister or rabbi, someone who is likely to listen  But don’t give yourself the additional burden of trying to deal with this alone. Just talking about how you got to where you are, releases an awful lot of the pressure, and it might be just the additional coping resource you need to regain your balance.  Suicidal feelings are, in and of themselves, traumatic. After they subside, you need to continue caring for yourself. Therapy is a really good idea. So are the various self-help groups available both in your community and on the Internet.  Well, it’s been a few minutes and you’re still with me. I’m really glad. Since you have made it this far, you deserve a reward. I think you should reward yourself by giving yourself a gift. The gift you will give yourself is a coping resource. Remember, back up near the top of the page, I said that the idea is to make sure you have more coping resources than you have pain. So let’s give you another coping resource, or two, or ten...! until they outnumber your sources of pain. Now, while this page may have given you some small relief, the best coping resource we can give you is another human being to talk with. If you find someone who wants to listen, and tell them how you are feeling and how you got to this point, you will have increased your coping resources by one. Hopefully the first person you choose won’t be the last. There are a lot of people out there who really want to hear from you. It’s time to start looking around for one of them.

So are the various self-help groups available both in your community and on the Internet.  Well, it’s been a few minutes and you’re still with me. I’m really glad. Since you have made it this far, you deserve a reward. I think you should reward yourself by giving yourself a gift. The gift you will give yourself is a coping resource. Remember, back up near the top of the page, I said that the idea is to make sure you have more coping resources than you have pain. So let’s give you another coping resource, or two, or ten...! until they outnumber your sources of pain. Now, while this page may have given you some small relief, the best coping resource we can give you is another human being to talk with. If you find someone who wants to listen, and tell them how you are feeling and how you got to this point, you will have increased your coping resources by one. Hopefully the first person you choose won’t be the last. There are a lot of people out there who really want to hear from you. It’s time to start looking around for one of them.  
I'm not suicidal now, but I have been there a lot. I have saved this for the next time I'm down in that hole.  
If you are feeling suicidal now, please stop long enough to read this. It will only take about five minutes. I do not want to talk you out of your bad feelings. I am not a therapist or other mental health professional -only someone who knows what it is like to be in pain. I don’t know who you are, or why you are reading this page. I only know that for the moment, you’re reading it, and that is good. I can assume that you are here because you are troubled and considering ending your life. If it were possible, I would prefer to be there with you at this moment, to sit with you and talk, face to face and heart to heart. But since that is not possible, we will have to make do with this. I have known a lot of people who have wanted to kill themselves, so I have some small idea of what you might be feeling. I know that you might not be up to reading a long book, so I am going to keep this short. While we are together here for the next five minutes, I have five simple, practical things I would like to share with you. I won’t argue with you about whether you should kill yourself. But I assume that if you are thinking about it, you feel pretty bad. Well, you’re still reading, and that’s very good. I’d like to ask you to stay with me for the rest of this page. I hope it means that you’re at least a tiny bit unsure, somewhere deep inside, about whether or not you really will end your life. Often people feel that, even in the deepest darkness of despair. Being unsure about dying is okay and normal. The fact that you are still alive at this minute means you are still a little bit unsure. It means that even while you want to die, at the same time some part of you still wants to live. So let’s hang on to that, and keep going for a few more minutes. Start by considering this statement: “Suicide is not chosen; it happens when pain exceeds resources for coping with pain.” That’s all it’s about. You are not a bad person, or crazy, or weak, or flawed, because you feel suicidal. It doesn’t even mean that you really want to die - it only means that you have more pain than you can cope with right now. If I start piling weights on your shoulders, you will eventually collapse if I add enough weights... no matter how much you want to remain standing. Willpower has nothing to do with it. Of course you would cheer yourself up, if you could. Don’t accept it if someone tells you, “that’s not enough to be suicidal about.” There are many kinds of pain that may lead to suicide. Whether or not the pain is bearable may differ from person to person. What might be bearable to someone else, may not be bearable to you. The point at which the pain becomes unbearable depends on what kinds of coping resources you have. Individuals vary greatly in their capacity to withstand pain. When pain exceeds pain-coping resources, suicidal feelings are the result. Suicide is neither wrong nor right; it is not a defect of character; it is morally neutral. It is simply an imbalance of pain versus coping resources. You can survive suicidal feelings if you do either of two things: (1) find a way to reduce your pain, or (2) find a way to increase your coping resources. Both are possible. Now I want to tell you five things to think about.  You need to hear that people do get through this -- even people who feel as badly as you are feeling now. Statistically, there is a very good chance that you are going to live. I hope that this information gives you some sense of hope. Give yourself some distance. Say to yourself, “I will wait 24 hours before I do anything.” Or a week. Remember that feelings and actions are two different things - just because you feel like killing yourself, doesn’t mean that you have to actually do it right this minute. Put some distance between your suicidal feelings and suicidal action. Even if it’s just 24 hours. You have already done it for 5 minutes, just by reading this page. You can do it for another 5 minutes by continuing to read this page. Keep going, and realize that while you still feel suicidal, you are not, at this moment, acting on it. That is very encouraging to me, and I hope it is to you. People often turn to suicide because they are seeking relief from pain. Remember that relief is a feeling. And you have to be alive to feel it. You will not feel the relief you so desperately seek, if you are dead. Some people will react badly to your suicidal feelings, either because they are frightened, or angry; they may actually increase your pain instead of helping you, despite their intentions, by saying or doing thoughtless things. You have to understand that their bad reactions are about their fears, not about you.  But there are people out there who can be with you in this horrible time, and will not judge you, or argue with you, or send you to a hospital, or try to talk you out of how badly you feel. They will simply care for you. Find one of them. Now. Use your 24 hours, or your week, and tell someone what’s going on with you. It is okay to ask for help. Try:  Send an anonymous e-mail to The Samaritans * Call 1-800-SUICIDE in the U.S. * Teenagers, call Covenant House NineLine, 1-800-999-9999 * Look in the front of your phone book for a crisis line * Call a psychotherapist * Carefully choose a friend or a minister or rabbi, someone who is likely to listen  But don’t give yourself the additional burden of trying to deal with this alone. Just talking about how you got to where you are, releases an awful lot of the pressure, and it might be just the additional coping resource you need to regain your balance.  Suicidal feelings are, in and of themselves, traumatic. After they subside, you need to continue caring for yourself. Therapy is a really good idea.

Can vouch for number 2. Even if you don’t end up doing it, just the idea that the suffering is not never-ending but has a definite time limit can be a huge relief. I used to bargain with myself that I would do this or that to improve my life—or that I had the permission to try anything, no matter how crazy—and if that didn’t work, I could kill myself after X time.  I don’t remember for how long time my first bargain was, but it wasn’t long. My current bargain is for 20 years. 👍

Just thought I’d thank you for helping me to release some of my own pain I’ve been struggling with. Your words truly hit me and I can’t thank you enough.  
I (15f) am going to kill myself today
PLEASE DON'T DO IT. No matter what you think, no matter what those voices tell you people CARE about you, someone in the world CARES about you. I CARE about you, I'm the same age as you if you want you can dm me please just DON'T DO IT.  
I (15f) am going to kill myself today
You're not alone. You did the right thing reaching out to this page. There are people here who care about you and want you to live and be happy. Please don't kill yourself, there are so many good things that can happen in your life, it's worth living for  
I (15f) am going to kill myself today
Think of all the sunsets you’ll miss. Think about never being able to eat your favorite food again. Never being able to sit in a warm bath. Never being able to experience the feeling of waking up after crying yourself to sleep. Never meet your future best friend.  This is hard. You are stronger than this feeling.  If you can’t find a reason to live for yourself, find a reason to live for someone else. For something else. Because you may not need the world, but the world needs YOU!!!  I may not know you, but I have love for you. I know you can do this.  
I (15f) am going to kill myself today
I sent you a message. Please let us know you’re okay. ((Hugs)) I know cyber hugs are not even close to the real thing but can’t hurt! I’m free to talk and been going through a rough time myself. Let’s talk about it!  
I (15f) am going to kill myself today
Please tell me your ok  
I (15f) am going to kill myself today
Dawg, I ain't special, nor do I know any suicide prevention lines (though some others have linked them) I'm around your age and I know what the fucks going on in your life, well not really but... Sorta I think I understand the feelings you're going through, I have some depressed moments that can go in for months but even through my lowest point in life I never once considered suicide because I have a firm belief that shit gets better. No matter what you're doing if you just hang on, speak to a friend (or me/others here) or family member(s), even seek those suicide prevention lines mentioned in other comments if it gets too bad because half decent people will happily help and care for you even at your lowest point. Even if you don't speak to anyone, I know from personal experience either the feelings go away on their own or something will happen that helps you or pushes you to seek your own help. Keep on fighting champ, don't give up. You've got so much to love for.

Sending you online hugs. 1-800-273-8255

4 years ago when I was your age I was in the exact same place and I went through with or at least tried three times.  I know everyone says this and it never feels like it’s true but it does get better. You are more important than you know.  I just plead with you to listen to this: you are important it may not seem like it and it may not feel like you are in a big way. But you have in the past or will in the future impact someone for the better live for that. Live for the people who you can help. If you can’t live for yourself anymore live for the people around you.  If everything in your life is bad make it your mission to make things better for others. Find a purpose because you are for a reason and you will do great things.  Who knows maybe in four years when you survive you’ll be here in my place looking at a thread that reminds yourself of what could have been and save a life.  I’ve turned my terrible experiences with suicide into something beautiful I have been there for many friends and have stopped several from going through with suicide. Live and become that for someone else.  Please DM me if you want to talk or need anything at all. Please choose life.

Hi beautiful. I know you’re in pain, I’ve walked the road. It gets better. You can’t see it when you’re in it. But I promise you there’s another side, a much brighter and more colourful one, the side that’s worth living is around the corner. The pain you’re in now can come to an end in another way. Please talk to someone, anyone, and please feel free to message me, I’m here for you and i’m with everyone else here when I say and mean it that I want you to stay breathing on this planet ❤️

hey, you still there?   a sub that I frequent is r/suicidewatch and I think that it's a great place to get some support.  Also feel free to dm me or just reply to this comment.   Do you have a favorite colour?  Favorite song? I know I'm a total internet stranger but I care about you and I really don't fucking want you to die.

I promise your pain will pass. I promise with all I have. I know that when we are down we don't believe in this phrase. But I assure you it is true. We never know when the tables will turn and everything is going to be okay again, but most of the times is when we are the worse we can be. Thus I believe your pain won't last long and you'll be happy again. Maybe someone new will appear unexpectedly in your life and bring good things and feelings. Your life has so much to offer to you. It is made up by ups and downs, you're in a down, but it means it will pass and soon you'll be in a up. And that ups are really worth it. Give it a chance and please don't do it. I know you probably don't believe it, but you are strong. I feel you are and I believe in your power. I am not a specialist, that means I don't know very well about how this works (how people's minds work and talking to them using the right words), I'm just speaking my heart. I and all this people are worried about you and that means we care. Sorry if it got confuse, I'm not a native english speaker and I realize that I'm not very good at it. If you feel you would like to talk to me about your problems or anything else pls dm me, I'm 18f, not much older than you. We could even have a lot in common :)  
I (15f) am going to kill myself today
Please just take a moment. Breathe and know that people do care. I understand and have been there myself. Take some time to focus on you and mental health. Put everything else to the side. You and your well being are the most important thing in this moment. I know it’s hard, but you need to ask for help. It’s ok to ask for help. These feelings can sometimes feel completely out of control and it’s a terrible feeling. I promise you it will pass. I promise you things change and do get better. There is a reason that you are here. Don’t give up. If you need help figuring out where to start please call the number others have posted to at least be able to talk it out for tonight.Tomorrow is a new day. Will be sending good thoughts your way. Hang in there!  
I (15f) am going to kill myself today
I love you.

100 reasons to not die.   We would miss you.  It's not worth the regret. Either by yourself if you failed or just simply left scars, or the regret everyone else feels by not doing enough to help you.  It does get better. Believe it or not it will eventually get better. Sometimes you have to go through the storm to get to the rainbow.  There's so much you would miss out on doing.  There is always a reason to live. It might not be clear right now, but it is always there.  So many people care, and it would hurt them if you hurt yourself.  You ARE worth it. Don't let anyone, especially yourself, tell you otherwise.  You are amazing.  A time will come, once you've battled the toughest times of your life and are in ease once again, where you will be so glad that you decided to keep on living. You will emerge stronger from this all, and won't regret your choice to carry on with life. Because things always get better.  What about all the things you've always wanted to do? What about the things you've planned, but never got around to doing? You can't do them when you're dead.  I love you. Even if only one person loves you, that's still a reason to stay alive.  You won't be able to listen to music if you die.  Killing yourself is never worth it. You'll hurt both yourself and all the people you care about.  There are so many people that would miss you, including me.  You're preventing a future generation, YOUR KIDS, from even being born.  How do you think your family would feel? Would it improve their lives if you died?  You're gorgeous, amazing, and to someone you are perfect.  Think about your favourite music artist, you'll never hear their voice again...  You'll never have the feeling of walking into a warm building on a cold day  Listening to incredibly loud music  Being alive is just really good.  Not being alive is really bad.  Finding your soulmate.  Red pandas  Going to diners at three in the morning.  Really soft pillows.  Eating pizza in New York City.  Proving people wrong with your success.  Watching the jerks that doubted you fail at life.  Seeing someone trip over a garbage can.  Being able to help other people.  Bonfires.  Sitting on rooftops.  Seeing every single country in the world.  Going on roadtrips.  You might win the lottery someday.  Listening to music on a record player.  Going to the top of the Eiffel Tower.  Taking really cool pictures.  Literally meeting thousands of new people.  Hearing crazy stories.  Telling crazy stories.  Eating ice cream on a hot day.

I think of these things and I think of having to do them or enjoy them alone. :(  
I (15f) am going to kill myself today
Don’t do it... it’s a permanent solution to a temporary problem. I know it doesn’t seem like it will ever pass, but I promise it will.  
I (15f) am going to kill myself today
Please, before you do that, try to get help immediately and see if it works. I'm certain it will. Call the hotline (1-800-273-8255 ), 911, or a friend or trusted guardian, or find a way to the hospital. There is nothing to lose if you reach out for help but potentially everything to gain. It's not worth killing yourself if haven't tried for help during this time. Please trust me when I tell you it can and will get better; I've been there too, but you must reach out for help. Reaching out and getting the attention and help you need is good and positive. Please. You are not alone, people care. I care. Look at everyone here commenting - we care. Mental health professionals care, and they will help you to the best of their ability. It was the best decision I made; please-  much love I send to you. *virtual hug*  
I (15f) am going to kill myself today
Hey love, please don't! Listen to all these comments from random strangers who believe in you. We're all here rooting for you. You don't have to do anything but sit here and be calm. No matter what your brain is saying right now, you can move past it. You have been strong enough to get to this point, so surely you can move forward.  We don't know you, but we do love you because you're so young and you have so much to live for. Fellow being of love and light, please don't leave.

Text 741 741. The world needs you.  
I (15f) am going to kill myself today
Your feelings are valid.  Many of us on here feel the same. With everything going on in the world, even people that weren’t struggling are now having a really hard time. For a long time my head was barely above water. Years. Not even just months and I still struggle. I know a lot of people said to reach out but please do. You can message me anytime as well. Tomorrow is a new day. I always try to find a few small things during the day that keep me grounded- spending time with pets, being outside, even watching a favorite movie. Things to look forward to, no matter how small they are.  Edit: I forgot to add that I also know people like to invalidate people struggling w depression. My family did it to me and totally turned their backs on me when I needed them most. That was 2 years ago. And I said I can either struggle with it or rise above it. If people don’t have depression they simply don’t understand the gravity of it. I tell people without it to compare it to how you feel on your worst days- losing a pet..failing a test..a car accident...whatever feelings and anxiety you have that last you a day or two, depressed people feel for months, on a mental roller coaster.  
I (15f) am going to kill myself today
please please please don’t do it <3  
I (15f) am going to kill myself today
Please don’t. The world will be ugly and cold without you. I guarantee your death would devastate many souls. Do you have any pets? They’ll wonder why you never came home. Your friends will miss decades from now. Your parents and other family will be in agony. Please hang on. It will get better.  
I (15f) am going to kill myself today
Please tell us you’re okay! Your light deserves to be in this world!  
I (15f) am going to kill myself today

Please stop, breathe, take a few moments. Read through these comments, there are good resources for you. There’s a subreddit, r/suicidewatch that has a community who may help a lot, and the “About ” section has a lot of resources for you! Hang in there! It’s tough, but you can do this.  
I (15f) am going to kill myself today
Please don’t. People love and need you ❤️  
I (15f) am going to kill myself today
Please don’t take your life. At 15 your world is full of pain but those are growing pains we have all experienced to some degree or another. Your best years are ahead of you. I wish there was some way I could show you. Without suffering there can be no joy. Please stay with us, please stay in the game.  
I (15f) am going to kill myself today
Please don’t do it! 21 years ago I was in your place. Things didn’t get better over night but they did get better. I have a son your age now, am happy most days. Are all days great, no but i wouldn’t want to miss any of the days I got to experience. Please reach out to the hotline numbers posted here or to someone who replied here. We all care about you ❤️  
I (15f) am going to kill myself today
You have your whole life ahead you, and illusions are destroying you right now. Please reply and let us know that you are okay.  
I (15f) am going to kill myself today
Are you still here, please still be, please try to get help killing yourself won’t fix anything. Please don’t do it, I know you’re going through a tough time but please don’t. It’s a dark time but there will be light you just have to wait, doing this means the darkness, sadness or whatever else wins, don’t let it.  
I (15f) am going to kill myself today
Please don’t do it. We are all here for you. <3  
I (15f) am going to kill myself today
If you need someone I am here. 23F. I will try my best to help you. I’m sorry you’re having a rough time, please don’t hurt yourself. Let someone help you.  
I (15f) am going to kill myself today
Hey bud. I’ve been there, I’ve tried to. I’m not going to say it’ll immediately get better, but just know that through it all, we’re here for you, ok?  
I (15f) am going to kill myself today
You have us now. We are here for you. Please tell someone about these thoughts there is help.  
I (15f) am going to kill myself today
I felt like this at 15 too... but please know it will get better!!!! I promise you. Please please please reach out if you need to  
I (15f) am going to kill myself today
Everything will be ok. Sometimes we feel like this, but it will pass. Try thinking of positive things, or staying mindful by saying, “this is only a thought.” Or “this is only an emotion.” If you need to, some good places to reach out are... Suicide Prevention Hotline: 1-800-273-8255 And  The Trevor Project: 1-866-488-7386

I am the problem though, I'm constantly bothering someone. I don't have a lot of friends I can talk to regularly nor do I have a girlfriend even though I want one. I'm 31 years old not married ( probably never will be) and I come to find out that the one person who has helped me doesn't care :( I thanked them because I was going through a hard time in my life and they gave me the kick in the ass I so desperately needed but he thought it was funny to continue to troll me, asking if I wanted a hook up ECT because I was bothering him.....he helped me out and he doesn't care 😭😭 he doesn't care that since he's helped me I've tried to get my life back on track  
I (15f) am going to kill myself today
I want to hear everything you have to say. Tell me your story. I care about you, I promise ❤.

You are not alone, there are communities of people with similar struggles. Please reach out, even if online alone. Also, have you tried journaling? As in (not on a computer or online) - but pick up a physical book and and a pen and start writing down your thoughts, as they appear. Or write a letter to someone (even a fictional character), or to yourself in the past or the future. You are not alone, and you are not lesser, and you are human and you deserve not to have the pain. You deserve peace, happiness, joy and a community of people who understand you.  
I (15f) am going to kill myself today
I'm so sorry for the pain you are in. I know the feeling of wanting to die as an escape from your reality. Please reach out to someone. You are valuable, and your life is precious. 1-800-273-8255 is the suicide prevention lifeline. Please give them a call. Going to therapy has helped me tremendously, and I would highly recommend you find a therapist you can start seeing, whether online or in-person. Please don't harm yourself or take your own life. There are so many people who value you and would love to help you.  
I (15f) am going to kill myself today
I felt this way, and wrote many of these words, when I was 15 (f). I’m 30 today. I’m here if you want to know about my journey. I’m here if you just want me to listen. I’m here to feel what is, to hear your story. I won’t know it exactly— no one can. But there is strength in sharing, in relating. And always a way forward again. There is profound beauty in caring. We’re here; look up. My heart, our hearts, they’re with you. Sending love.  
I (15f) am going to kill myself today
Please don’t kill yourself! You are loved and you are important. You’re so young, and you have a big and bright future ahead of you. Everyone on this post is here for you, and I urge you to call the Suicide Prevention Hotline- 1-800-273-8255. Please call. Also, if you need someone to talk to, message me.  
I (15f) am going to kill myself today
As a person who has nearly done this, It's not worth it. You can power through this, We believe you...  
I (15f) am going to kill myself today
🥺 please don’t, you deserve to see tomorrow, you deserve to see next week, you deserve to see next year, and you deserve to see the world become a better place. Please I beg of you, don’t do it. (I hope I’m not to late)  
I (15f) am going to kill myself today
You're not alone, there are many more people than you think in this same situation, If you would like (I'm pretty sure) my dms are open and you can message me if you need somebody to talk to, but please, whatever you do, you can make it through this, you just need to believe. If you believe, YOU WILL make it through this.  
I (15f) am going to kill myself today
Please don't hurt yourself. I don't know you, but I can guarantee that the world is going to be better with you in it.  
I (15f) am going to kill myself today

I (15f) am going to kill myself today
Don't please you're the same age as my son and i wouldn't want him hurting so bad that he felt this way the answer,when i was your age i felt like you i felt there was nothing to live for but there was for me and there is for you  
I (15f) am going to kill myself today
This is a cry for help. Deep down this isn’t what you want. I know from experience, people who have committed suicide make plans weeks, months after they intend to do it so people don’t suspect. You want help. And I sincerely hope you get it. Good luck, best wishes  
I (15f) am going to kill myself today
Call 911 ASAP. They will make sure you're taken care of. Praying for you!  
I (15f) am going to kill myself today
Thank you for not committing suicide yesterday.  I was really worried about you.  Still am because I still care.  Please tell your family and friends who care about you.  I know how hard it is to get help but it is worth it because your life is priceless.   (BELOW IS THE LINK TO AN UPDATE POST) UPDATED POST

Hi! I'm also 15f, and I'm always here if you need to talk to someone. I understand how it feels to be alone, but don't worry, there's always people who are here for you!  
I (15f) am going to kill myself today
You are never alone with how you feel. If you need someone to talk to I am here for you. I’ve survived my suicidal days and I can truly say it gets better. It gets easier to manage if you take it a day at a time. You deserve happiness and to be at peace. Message me if you need to. If not you can reach out to the Crisis Text Line ( sorry not trying to advertise just giving out a suggestion) and a crisis counselor and talk to you. I pray for the healing of your heart.  
I (15f) am going to kill myself today

I wish therapists received health safety inspections like how restaurants do. Send in someone undercover, push at the therapists to see if their responses could be damaging to the patients, and then give them a score and include where they went wrong. This one would fail and be shut down. Slap a big red F on the door to his practice

Or screen them. I ask if they are religious and how they feel about homosexuality an will it interfere with my therapy an them being professional.  In my experience it usually does when they are Mormons or evangelicals.

I second this. As a therapist, we need these therapists to be reported. They make a bad name for our profession and damage people. I’m sorry this happened to you but please report to the state licensing board. Especially right now?! F this crap makes me fume.

Therapist here as well. This is entirely unprofessional, uncalled for, judgmental, and so many other things I can come up with. Please don’t think we are all like this! Keep looking until you find one you like. Try Psychology Today, you can search for therapists and read about them.

Sorry this happened to you. In addition to what all the previous commenters said (DEFINITELY never go back), some therapists can be reviewed on Yelp, Google, etc. I would give him the lowest possible rating, and then calmly restate the facts of what happened. Even if he is never punished officially, he will lose a great deal of business, as he should.

Do not go back. We are all entitled to our opinion. However this therapist will not be able to help you with that attitude. Please find another. Therapy should make you feel comfortable, accepted, and wanted.

Then what is it?  
You should read up on hormones and gene expression. Being gay is as natural as anything else your body does, because...your body does it.  
What? If you wanna go that way..  1- There are hormonal treatments to literally make the homosexuality desire go away  2- Even nature makes mistakes, speacilly after we start  to fuck with it, thousands of years ago.  Cancer is natural because my body does it? Maybe, but there are factors like polution, AIDS is something that ur body does to itself, also, so it's all natural..  Just because there s something different, doesn't mean it's bad, I'm not saying that being gay is bad, ffs I don't give a shit about people s sexual orientation, what I stated is just a fact, homosexuality is not the natural behavament of the human race, animals usually develop this when they never have females to mate with  Stop misinterpreting what Im saying I am aware of most of the subjects related to this matter  
My therapist told me its unnaturall to be gay
You need a new therapist and that therapist told you such garbage should not be helping anyone. Therapists should not be judgement or push their views on you, especially if they’re homophobic.

Wow that's awful. You need to get a therapist that will help you, not one who will tell you that you're a problem.

I mean, not in this context, but a therapist might have justification for telling you that you're a problem.   E.G. any abusive or narcissistic asshole who has a therapist.

Therapy can’t “fix” you, by pulling the rug out from under you, regardless of what your issue(s) are.   Therapy is supposed to help you see small steps you can do to become a better you...   If a person’s therapist tells them that they are a problem, this will not help them to solve what’s going on, but by asking how the things that happen make someone feel, and for introspection on their part and then helping lead to the conclusions that will inspire the most positive behavior change...  that’s what therapy is about.   Can’t tell someone they’re a jerk and they instantly stop being one, you know?

True. But if a therapist believes his patient is a dick, he should still try to find a way to say it that's wouldn't be taken as offensive. After all, the goal is to help the patient.

If someone comes in with very different beliefs and views than myself and that I might consider dickish I still can’t call them out on it. I can gently challenge, but I’m not able to change their minds. If it has nothing to do with their goals it’s likely not even a topic I can touch.  An example might be someone who’s culture is very different than my own (thinking in terms of gender roles and expectations). I’m 100% about equal partnerships and not good with men being the “head of the family” ideals in my beliefs. But if that is their culture I have to work with that no matter how much I wish I could change them. Same if someone is homophobic or really misogynistic, I can’t make them “see the light” or the error of their ways. I don’t agree with their beliefs, and don’t like them, but I can’t just be like “hey do you think your issues with people are a result of your harsh and homophobic ways or because you’re a misogynist?” Guarantee I will never see them again and what good have I done for anyone?

Yeah this didn't work with me as a therapist back in my 20's told me that I was too much of a pessimist. No shit because my family was wholly ignorant on what drug addiction can do to everyone not just the addict. Thousands of dollars stolen from the gov't and leading to more money being bled helping the addict in prison, CPS visiting your house, and the addict is dead and no longer a problem later, I still reel from the shock of it years later.  The only good that came out of that stupid therapist was my ASD diagnosis and that's it. I'm 30 now and am currently trying to get disability meanwhile I still occasionally have problems with my emotions due to screw-ups causing fights among my brother and mother. I've had no help since graduating college and the only thing that's happened was my grandmother and uncle who was the addict died and that's it.  
My therapist told me its unnaturall to be gay
Being gay is not unnatural. You were born this way, it doesn’t get any more natural than that. Never go back to this therapist, they are unprofessional and uneducated. I’m here if you need to talk to someone. I’m not a professional, just someone who cares.  
My therapist told me its unnaturall to be gay
I am so sorry this happened to you. If this person is a licensed counselor, it's likely this goes against their ethical code and if you feel comfortable doing so, you should report them. You may not be the first or last person they hurt in this way.  
My therapist told me its unnaturall to be gay
At the very least report him. No one should go through what you went through. I'm so sorry. You are perfect the way you are!  
My therapist told me its unnaturall to be gay
Change therapist not yourself. You are completly valid  
My therapist told me its unnaturall to be gay

I am so sorry this happened to you! He is wrong. I hope you consider reporting him. Whether or not you feel it was because you were in a vulnerable state or not, you did the right thing. Hugs.  
My therapist told me its unnaturall to be gay
I’m a counselor, and it is unethical to speak this way to a client. I am very sorry that you’ve had this experience, but please believe this isn’t all of us. I would find another therapist. This one is biased and unethical.  
My therapist told me its unnaturall to be gay
Thats horrible!! Imagine going into a career where your one job is to help people feel better about themselves and then saying an outright degrading lie like this. Definitely report him. If I remember correctly you can sometimes look for therapists based off specialties including those who work well with lgbtq clients. I think even some online therapists can be found with those parameters as well.  There is nothing unnatural about being gay. I hope you find a therapist that understands that and can help you properly. Please don’t let his cruel words get to you, they are only an indicator of the quality of his heart, not of yours. 🖤  
My therapist told me its unnaturall to be gay
Screw that noise. What a horrible thing to say to a vulnerable person.  Darling, you are wonderful and beautiful just the way you are.  DO NOT go to any therapist that doesn't believe that.  
My therapist told me its unnaturall to be gay
So sorry. His job is to help, not judge. Report him!  
My therapist told me its unnaturall to be gay
I simply agree with the majority of comments below. Therapists are supposed to help you accept who you are, not make you question further or feel bad about anything you tell them. I have to ask, but why were you in therapy in the first place? I don't mean that being gay should be anything to do with it, in fact, I don't think it should at all, but society isn't as always as accepting as I wish it was. So... why did you feel you needed therapy? I'd do some research into your local therapists and what they specialise in so you can get a suitable fit next time. Ask in advance what their approach to sexual orientation is. You should NOT have to, but given this experience, you don't want to risk these kinds of comments again. And it's unfathomable that a therapist would say this to you. They're clearly NOT a good therapist. I hope you find a better therapist in the future. And maybe you should report them for discrimination.  But that's up to you if you want to go down that path. Just know that he is WRONG.  
My therapist told me its unnaturall to be gay
Omg, good on you for storming out! 👏 Next steps, find a new therapist... I found mine recommended on my city’s subreddit, check out psychologytoday.com, or check out your health insurance website... usually they have a list of providers... you can also call them. Before meeting with a therapist I checked out the practices website and searched their names online to look for ratings and specialties. Do not feel you need to provide that person with an excuse or ever speak to them again. Therapists and doctors are there to serve you, they are service people. You are the one in power here, take your $ elsewhere. After that, feel FREE to report the last person you met with... you came into the situation open and vulnerable and you were met with ignorance... that’s very serious and damaging... I wonder how many other individuals this person has negatively affected in this way.  
My therapist told me its unnaturall to be gay
I would call him, tell him that you'll no longer be his patient, and then read off a list of all the animals that "naturally" are homosexual.   Include at least 20.   If he hangs up, I might even send a letter.  #Dumbass

Also, not to read too much into it, but if the therapist is affiliated with a religion that's dictating his homophobia, I might consider using that as a screener for future therapists and/or trying the Secular Therapy Project.  
My therapist told me its unnaturall to be gay
Don't go back to that one. Do find a better one. It's not unnatural for you, and that's what matters. I don't know where you're located, but in my experience most therapists don't let their personal bigotry get in the way of their job like that.  
My therapist told me its unnaturall to be gay
Yes please get a new therapist. In my opinion, even if he didn’t outright tell you that was his beliefs, it’s great that you found out because its important to have a therapist that doesn’t have core beliefs that contradict who you are as a person  
My therapist told me its unnaturall to be gay
Clients have rights. One of them is to not be discriminated against. I might look into reporting this somehow  
My therapist told me its unnaturall to be gay
WOAH. THAT THERAPIST IS A PIECE OF SHIT. Please don’t EVER believe that! Definitely do NOT go back. Therapists are supposed to HELP you by being non-judgmental This dipshit literally did the exact opposite!!! What a croc! I’m so sorry you had to hear that nonsense!! hugs being gay is as natural as being born  
My therapist told me its unnaturall to be gay
Report him!!!  I'm not sure how you connected or were referred but try psychology today and you can actually select someone who specializes in LGBT clients.  (Often LGBT themselves!)

Absolutely report him, if you’re comfortable. Also definitely find another therapist! And if they’re profile or website does not have anything to indicate that they’re LGBTQ+ friendly, call and ask before your schedule. That shouldn’t have happened, and I’m so sorry that it did  
My therapist told me its unnaturall to be gay
What the fuck??? Wow I’m so sorry you had to go through this bigotry. What an awful person. I can’t believe they have a therapist license!!! I’d report him if you have the energy.  
My therapist told me its unnaturall to be gay
Report him to his licensing board. He shouldn’t be practicing.  
My therapist told me its unnaturall to be gay
REPORT !!!! Report this guy if you feel comfortable advocating.  
My therapist told me its unnaturall to be gay
You need a different therapist. Depending where you are in the world it used to be common practice to conduct conversion therapy. This has since been somewhat abolished. However, it is still a real thing and that therapist should not be practicing with his own (misplaced) opinions.  Be who you need to be. Screw that therapist. Find one that is on your side.  Finding the right therapist for you is usually a bit challenging. But stick with it and you will find one you click with.  
My therapist told me its unnaturall to be gay
That is HORRIBLE. Report him. That’s awful.  
My therapist told me its unnaturall to be gay
Wtf report report report!! Sorry you had to even deal with that  
My therapist told me its unnaturall to be gay
Change therapist. It’s very unethical of the therapist to say something like that.  
My therapist told me its unnaturall to be gay
Please report this person  
My therapist told me its unnaturall to be gay
Unnatural? As in not occurring in nature? Well, scientifically, that’s completely wrong. Debate common all you want, but I can’t think of any species of animal that is all strictly heterosexual. That would be one thing but they’re a therapist? They’re wrong on a lot of levels.  
My therapist told me its unnaturall to be gay
It is perfectly natural to be gay!  I am so sorry your ex-therapist told you this I hope you report him I wish I could just hug you and tell you that you’re valid af right now That’s so traumatic  
My therapist told me its unnaturall to be gay
I hope you end up finding a better therapist. What an absurdity. How can someone, especially a therapist say something like that? And if you can, make sure to report him.  
My therapist told me its unnaturall to be gay
I’m so sorry this happened, it’s very unprofessional and unethical. Every professional therapist must be a member of a governing body so we are in line with their code of ethics and also so clients have someone to contact if they have a complaint or concern around the therapists practice. I would encourage you to report this to their governing body, it should be stated on their website and they might include their membership number. Therapists should genuinely have unconditional acceptance for their clients, there are a lot of good therapists out there too and I hope you find one you click with  
My therapist told me its unnaturall to be gay
No need to go back. Conversion therapy (or reparative therapy) has been banned in a number of states and is highly unethical IMO. I have never met you, but I can guarantee that you are beautiful and worthwhile because you are a human. That therapist clearly does not know your worth and you are perfect just the way that you are. ❤️  
My therapist told me its unnaturall to be gay
Absolutely DONT go back. When I was first figuring out my sexuality and gender and still steeped in a religion I was trying to get out of I had a therapist who told me this. After I came out to her everything we did became about me being queer and turned into conversion therapy. It has left me in a much worse place. It isn’t unnatural to be gay but it IS unnatural and so damaging to go through conversion therapy.  
My therapist told me its unnaturall to be gay
Dont go back to them, and look around for different therapist. See what they are like, make sure they are someone who is going to help you and not break you down more and actually know how to do their job  
My therapist told me its unnaturall to be gay
 Being gay IS NATURAL. 2. Your therapist is unprofessional and you need to report him. Shut him down.

YES, and before anyone gets a chance to snowball this into "Let's just shut everyone down we don't like," he is violating his duty and if I didn't do my work because I didn't like the client's "lifestyle" (god DAMN do I hate that word), I'd be fired immediately. So yes, let's shut everyone down who refuses to do their job for bullshit reasons.

I hate the ‘cancelled culture’, but i feel like this may be an example I would look the other way. He needs to be informed, have evidence of thi happening and if it is true he needs to be shut down before he hurts someone else.

Agreed on all points. Cancel culture is definitely BS, but when it’s a mental health “professional,” they could actually harm someone and THAT needs to be dealt with. This is where that sort of outrage should be placed, not on some ignorant idiot rando on Twitter...

yeah and anyway what does my sexual orientation have to do with me wanting to feel better? even if it is true what he is saying ( which its obviously not ) how the fuck is it relevant. It really felt like he was trying to make me feel bad or judge me.

Even science can explain homosexuality, how dare he said it is unnatural ?! He is probably not even qualified to be a therapist. Leave and find you another one!  
My therapist told me its unnaturall to be gay
I know this has already been said but please, PLEASE report him to his state board. As someone going through school for counseling, they take this VERY seriously and will assist you.  
My therapist told me its unnaturall to be gay
do. not. go. back.  
My therapist told me its unnaturall to be gay
dump his ass, don’t know if that is something he can be fired for but fuck him, i’m sorry you had to go through that.  
My therapist told me its unnaturall to be gay
Report himmmmm  
My therapist told me its unnaturall to be gay
He doesn't sound like an open minded therapist. I wouldnt let that stop you from going to therapy altogether. I would search for one who is LGBTQ+ friendly.  
My therapist told me its unnaturall to be gay
Report this therapist immediately  
My therapist told me its unnaturall to be gay
Find a new therapist and report your old one. My last therapist was sorta transphobic so I found a new one. It took awhile but I did it. I wish you the best of luck OP. I’m sorry this is something that you have to deal with.  
My therapist told me its unnaturall to be gay
Give me his address and I'll torch his office.  But really, report him and get a new therapist. That's completely inappropriate. Even if those are his beliefs, his bias should be left at the door. This is disgusting and inappropriate.  
My therapist told me its unnaturall to be gay
It's unnatural for him to be a therapist. Report him to the board and change him.  
My therapist told me its unnaturall to be gay
You can shop around for therapists until you find one that is right for you.  You can also report crappy ones to their professional association so they can face consequences when they do awful things.  Best of luck  
My therapist told me its unnaturall to be gay
Therapist here and I’m so sorry. I’m so sorry you sought the help of the healer and experienced more harm. This is beyond unprofessional, it downright harmful and dangerous.  I would encourage you to look i tot he laws and ethics of how to send in a complaint about this counselor. But also do what feels right for you right now. If doing that would stress you out more then don’t do it and be gentle with yourself.  Good luck.  
My therapist told me its unnaturall to be gay
I'm a guy who is pan, has been married to a man for 16 years, and I'm also a therapist.  I'm so unbelievably sorry that happened to you. There is nothing wrong with you. You are beautiful and whole just as you are. No compassionate or good therapist would ever do this. What they said was damaging, wrong, and completely unethical. If you feel led, please report this to their board. All LCPs, LPCCs, LCSWs, and LMFTs have state licensing boards where you can go online or call to file a complaint. If you need help I will help you.  
My therapist told me its unnaturall to be gay
It's happened to me too. Even with "LGBT allied" therapists. Sorry.

Yesterday during virtual therapy, I became quite dissociated and as my therapist was helping me become grounded again, a fucking bird flew full speed into the window directly in front of my desk. I was quickly startled back into reality, and it startled my therapist too because she heard it happen! We died laughing about it through the rest of the session.

Thanks! I often make him laugh but I’ve never heard him snort before. It was just so cute.  It was the most interesting therapy session I’ve ever had because I also caught him rolling his eyes at me once and I guess it was accidental and I don’t think he knew I saw it. His reaction like “my God. This bitch for real?” Because I’m basically a dumbass and I straight up told him I was gonna do a dumb thing and he was trying to talk me out of it but... that didn’t work.  
Made my therapist snort
Me and mine had a good laughing sesh last night too :)  
Made my therapist snort
Oh man making your therapist laugh/when they make you laugh is just so warm and wholesome.  I had a really good moment with mine last month (first time doing a video session) and he was at his home and I was at my home. RIGHT IN THE MIDDLE of our session I hear the most high-pitched, aggressive dog barking. I was startled for a moment (cause I don't like loud, unexpected noises) but the LOOK on my therapists FACE had me in STITCHES. He's a warm and gentle looking man but he turned his head and SHOT DAGGERS at his pup for interrupting our session.  I was like "is that... a dog?" and he just groans in defeat (as the pupper continues to bark for attention) and goes and picks him up to pet him and its the cutest lil pupper ever I start giggling so much because dogs are super precious. I couldn't stop aweeeeee-ing.  I also found it SUPER funny/ironic that my therapist has a "needy" dog. He said that he's training it to be a therapy dog, which was also super cute.  Man I love dogs.

“It be like that sometimes”: the product of a generation that can’t afford therapy
I empathise, but also, here's some problem solving: I've sort of been in this position many times. When I was doing my undergrad, definitely, but then you have access to student support = sort of free therapy.  There have been other times where I thought I was in this position, but really, with reallocation of funds, I wasn't. I don't think I realised what a priority my mental health was. Reduced some things like, nights out, and was able to. If you have absolutely no spare money, then charity organisations or government support can help.  If you look through the accredited therapy organisations (in the UK it's babcp for cbt, abcs, mct institute for mct, ukcp and bacp for most everything else), and other listings, you can often find someone who doesn't charge too much. A fair few therapists in my experience do reduced rates for low earners.  My person is £40 for a 50 minute session. There are plenty of others who do fees like that.  I usually have fortnightly or monthly sessions, as I don't need more than that. In addition I do sit downs with myself to go over what I need to do/not do.  Also, some charge less for phone or Skype therapy as they don't have to hire a room.  Additionally, there's SO MANY free evidence-based psychotherapeutic materials online. CCI is a good example (I've posted a list here before; let me know if you want links). And you can, I have, made massive improvements using those tools.  Hope this helps.

I really appreciate this reply and how thought out it is. There is always some kind of support to be found! I’d like to add that we are truly lucky to live in a generation that actually understands the importance of mental health, previous generations had no such luck and were absolutely clueless about it.

Remember that abusive voice is not without its merits. I'm sure it has 1000's of individual hells attached to it, but it is also includes the great parts of you. The abuse we face makes us who we are, great and terrible. Be proud of who you are and look forward to who you will become. Stay strong on the journey!

People do say shit about other people under their breath. People are assholes. Not all people, all the time though. People also say really nice things under their breath about people. You gotta choose who you want to listen to, and choose which person you want to be. I get cluster migraines. And a warning i am going to get them is weird colors and floating objects beforehand. It is an absolute sign to take some pain pills because I am about to be on the ground in pain. I also have menieres disease so I have a thing called drop attacks where I get very dizzy and the world spins and I get vertigo and have to go down to the ground. It rarely happens but normally for about a half a day before hand I see weird shapes and stuff. I normally do not remember that this is a thing that happens before hand and am surprised every time.

Not everywhere and not by everyone. We have to have standards and allow ourselves to keep toxic people at an arm's length or more if we notice them, or we get sucked into negative echo chambers. I swear, my immediate surroundings got nothing but sweeter during this hard time - all finding different ways to help each other out, make people's days a little brighter and just being their best selves. Meanwhile you click one wrong subreddit and all you see is poison and vitriol.  The world may be a sea of nastiness but if we look for islands, we can find them.

The world has always been nasty. Keep it in perspective. It has also been full of good. And kindness.  And compassion. And love. Just not this post.

True life used to be pretty bad back then, but I'm talking about the modern world, post 2012. This post was to pour out my grievances with how I feel, that doesn't mean I don't have kindness, compassion or love. I've done a lot of good deeds for people so don't judge me on my character over one post that you deem is negative to everyone. I have a certain disdain for people that can't keep their potential negative thoughts to themselves. I think that's human nature to not like someone that disrespects you. Yea there's good in everyone, but some people don't exercise their good, natured traits and let their negativity flourish instead of having a healthy balance.

Look I don’t know why country your in and how people act there or treat people with cerebral palsy. But in my experience that’s absolutely not something that’s common at all among strangers. I think you should go to a psychologist or a psychiatrist and discuss your concerns honestly. The flashes with the headaches is something I’d get checked out as well. Even if it is normal for your mum, it doesn’t mean it’s normal for everyone. The only way to be sure is to talk to a specialist. Either way I hope it’s all okay!

Remember that it is all about positive affirmation. There's always going to be negativity, unavoidable negativity. What should you do? If it really makes you uncomfortable, leave or move away from the people that are negative. Also don't fall into the habit of self diagnosis, you should leave that to a professional, where your rights as a person can avoid some of the abuses that modern day critics bring to the table. There is also the three percent wacko factor. In this economy it might be closer to five percent. So, no matter how cool, or how well mannered you are, and how positive your outlook, there's a percentage of people who are just not going to jive with what you are doing. Their presence has a tendency to make problems for many people. Learn to recognize it, so you can avoid feeding into the negative reenforcement.  
Is it just me or is society becoming increasingly toxic ?
Not wrong, I just had a conversation with my sister about her getting extremely sad because she was private messaged by someone (She could not block them) and so she was forced to read the VERY toxic and messed up things the person sent her.  
Is it just me or is society becoming increasingly toxic ?
I feel the same way, but it might have something to do with me moving. Also, you might have silent migraines with visual aura. You don’t always need migraine pain to have a migraine.

I don't know if you will see this, but strangely it seems like you are getting carbon monoxide poisoning. We had a new rental that had a tenant inside who described similar issues when I was talking to him. He though the issues were psychological in nature and because of that he was on rent assistance and welfare. He experienced auditory and visual hallucinations at home but associated it with his other conditions. When we got all the inspections finished and found the problem, he was a changed man and was able to be gainfully employed again in a matter of months. The location-based headaches and hallucinations are right on track with that diagnosis. The auditory part is a more rare symptom and possibly associated with a gas leak instead. It is a long shot but seems similar to a situation that is often found in older homes. A simple test can rule it out for you.

Interesting, I live in an apartment. The apartment complex was built in the 70's so my apartment definitely has some age to it. There has been gas leaks and fires in the apartment complex I'm living in.

i'm not currently working, luckily, but it does seem like all my friends with jobs are having a much harder time dealing with customers right now. i think there is a general level of stress for everyone and some people REALLY externalize all their issues. my friend works at the post office and she says that customers are more irate basically every day. i've also seen a TON of news stories about violence against store employees. it's really upsetting but i don't think it's just you.

It's not just you. It's a landmine field out there. Some people get lucky and they don't step on any mines but the field is full of mines. Learn to navigate as safe as possible.

It doesn't sound like schizophrenia, so I wouldn't worry too much. As a therapist, I would say it's likely that both A) shitty people are going to say mean things sometimes and also B) when you have an anxiety disorder you are more prone to have a negative bias towards believing that someone is saying something bad about you, especially if you have a fear of being judged or ridiculed. Even if you are hearing things that aren't real, it doesn't necessarily mean you are crazy. Often times it indicates your fears are becoming larger/difficult to control and may need more management. I would strongly suggest seeking professional help from a qualified therapist to help manage this anxiety.

Have you told him about what is happening to you? He won't be able to help you unless you open up and collaborate. If you don't feel comfortable, there are always other therapists. I know it can be frustrating to find a good fit.

I don't think any amount of talking will fix a thing for me. Only reason I still have him is because I don't have many friends and we have a few things in common.

There are lots of other therapy styles besides talk therapy. But if you don't believe therapy can help, then it's not going to help lol. Therapy is all about what you as a client are willing to bring to the table. All the therapist can do is help you connect the dots and start to make changes that help rather than hurt you.

Nope not you. A majority are very toxic, angry & violent

If the thought of others talking about you is causing you distress, you should definitely seek out a professional. There's certainly a lot of negativity out there, but if you're genuinely worried you're hearing these things and they're not there, it's best you see a clinician. Hope it all turns out well.

How quickly is this change happening that you are noticing?  If it's rather quickly (like inside a year or two) then there may be something for you that is happening that is changing your perceptions.  If you are talking about something like the gradual decline of civilized civilization, well yeah, the world is getting more complex and difficult to manage socially every year it seems.  The world, and people, as a whole don't all change that quickly, however.

I will only add to the other comments that schizophrenia isn't the only mental disorder with psychosis. Severe depression can cause it too. I would advice for you to contact a medical professional and to discuss with them in depth abouth this.

I take notes of important things and it's really helpful.

Me too. Right after every session I open up the notes app on my phone and write down as much as I can remember. Then later on I copy my notes into a journal and add any thoughts I have.

If you don't mind sharing and if the information is general enough, what important things do you typically note down?

I also do this. I get super anxious in social situations and disassociate so taking notes helps me a lot.

You might be processing stuff on unconscious level, it’s quite normal to forget content of the session or parts of it. It doesn’t mean it’s not working. If it helps, take notes. ETA: depending on the orientation of your therapy , it should be ok, unless it’s CBT where you may need to do homework and actively working towards goals. In any other orientation, talk to your therapist about it and see what feels so difficult to remember

i'm a therapist. there is this idea that the patient needs to work. arguing by analogy is problematic, but i think this one's important to consider: does a patient undergoing surgery need to work? the answer is no, the patient just needs to tend to their wounds in between operations. it's fine that you don't remember. trying to remember could be problematic if you're exerting too much effort. the process is unconscious, you just have to show up each week and talk about what feels important to you. if a patient came to me with this concern, i might increase sessions to twice per week, as it sounds like you're ready to increase the depth of the work.

Funny you said this I almost posted this. I feel like I hang onto her every word, I am listening, I want to remember everything she’s said so I can draw on it later but it’s extremely hard. I’ve never had this problem before. It’s like it’s so important I’m trying too hard to take it in, but I also can’t just chill that my brain glitches. I also haven’t told mine.  
Is it normal that I forget almost everything my therapist said as soon as our session ends?
I started taking a notebook with me. I didn't write down a lot, but "homework" and resources were important to write down for me.  I also briefly journaled in the car.  It gave me a way to reset but also reflect later. This did go into why I was there in the first place though, PTSD made my memory shitty, so I've had to come up with coping mechanisms for every part of my life to help with that. The biggest thing was having a notebook and keeping it in my purse. My travelers notebook is my second brain now.

Literally same. And the worst part is she always quotes me on what I've said in other sessions and I'm like "... Umh okay yeah" and I just agree with her, because me telling her I have a bad memory = me just trying to get out of talking about it, apparently.

mine says the same lol but since I got diagnosed with dissociative disorder (close to amnesia) she doesn't mind refreshing what we talked about

Contrary to what many have said here, I believe that writing down something during the therapy session interrupts the flow and delays the process, but I confess that several times I felt like drawing while expressing myself. You do not need to absorb 100% of what was said by the therapist, what counts is how you receive what was said. It is necessary to keep channels opened to take the findings as a large group of ideas and emotions that have no form and that contain a good amount of information that is kept by the unconscious mind. These learnings appear as insights when faced with the problem. It is at this point that we can consciously practice what was covered during the session.

Not during therapy session. After.

I had the same problem. I talked to my T about it and I am allow to record our sessions in voice memo on my phone. I was also given the option to take notes in session. I know most Therapists don’t allow recording but I didn’t address my issue until 2 years in and I’m not allowed to share the recordings they are for my personal use. I listen to them at times when I need guidance. It has been really helpful. Hearing his voice and then I can remember his face. I don’t have all my sessions and lost a bunch in a phone transfer, modern technology fail, but he reminds me to go back to them. However, some will not allow that but it’s worth a discussion. But a notebook is always a good option. Best of luck. You are not alone.

I forget a lot too. Only after 6+ years are things sticking with me.  I still take notes though for the things I want to be sure to remember.

Studies show that patients forget about 60% of everything that's said to them in doctor's offices and that has to do with your life.  I don't think there have been any studies on how much client's forget what their therapists tall them. Anecdotally, I would say it's about 90%. Source: Am Therapist.

Is it normal that I forget almost everything my therapist said as soon as our session ends?
I always forget, but my sessions are recorded. I once needed to remember what was said and asked for the tape. It was a truly fascinating experience, because it was very different from how I remembered it only a week later. I think we are processing things on an unconscious level and I find myself coming back to things at later points, which I didn't remember to begin with. You can of course write them down during or right after, if you explicitly want to remember.

Hello! I don't think your experience is odd or out of the ordinary. I find that I sometimes get distracted or otherwise tune people out when we're talking, and I usually chalk it up to my social anxiety. I find myself observing my mannerisms, posture, facial expressions, etc, and less on what my peer is saying to me. When I realize that's happening I turn my attention once more to the person speaking to me. The therapist in me wants to encourage you to pay attention to what's going on in the moment. Are you getting distracted? If so, what's grabbing your attention instead? Are you tuning her out? Is she talking too much? Are the discussed topics difficult or emotionally heavy? Caveat: I'm not treating you so I say bring this up to your therapist. She can best help you troubleshoot why this keeps happening to you because she's in the room with you when its happening.  Also, therapy is (usually) just 1 hour out of 168 hours in a week. I think it absolutely makes sense why you can't remember everything you discuss in session. Be kind to you + your brain :)  
Is it normal that I forget almost everything my therapist said as soon as our session ends?
Definitely tell your therapist. Communication is key. She might be able to help with that either by changing something about how she communicates with you or by giving you an idea of what you can do to stay focused and remember. Trust in her  
Is it normal that I forget almost everything my therapist said as soon as our session ends?
I actually take notes immediately after leaving therapy. I might go into a coffee shop just to do it. A few years ago, I instantly emailed my professor about my therapy sessions b/c he guided me through my struggles with depression.  You could even take notes during the session especially since I’m assuming they’re remote now.  
Is it normal that I forget almost everything my therapist said as soon as our session ends?
Me! I used to have my therapist write down stuff I needed to do!!  
Is it normal that I forget almost everything my therapist said as soon as our session ends?
I always did. Then I started keeping a little notebook in my pocket along with a small pen. I get out to my car and jot down a few things about the session. Just a bullet point or two. Sometimes something the therapist said that I want to remember. I try to review during the week to think about it and definitely look it over while I'm in the waiting room before the next session. Occasionally I write a few other things during the week about it, or about other issues or thoughts that I might want to bring up. I really like having that continuity and automatically having a starting point each week. I really think that growth and change won't happen very fast if you only give it that 50 minute chunk each week. (This is not to say I'm this totally evolved being, but reading over a year's worth of notes reminds me of how much change and growth I've experienced.)

Write key points on scrap paper or draw a doodle to associate with it.   Visual learners tend not to remember the specific things people say, but looking at something you wrote when it was said should jog your memory.  
Is it normal that I forget almost everything my therapist said as soon as our session ends?
Talk to your therapist about it! Bring it in to the room and it could be something that the two of you work on together. I would hope that a therapist wouldn’t chastise you about not paying enough attention and instead lean into it with you and figure out what’s going on—is it too close, are you distracted, does it happen about a particular topic, etc etc etc. good luck! :)  
Is it normal that I forget almost everything my therapist said as soon as our session ends?
Like many on here, I write a journal entry or notes after session of any revelations or anything that I need to process further.  I read in one of these subs that a client audio records sessions without their therapist's knowledge and I honestly think that's wrong.  I think your therapist would be fine with you recording a session of it seemed like it would help you and if you assured them you wouldn't post it somewhere.  It's a convo you should have with your T.  
Is it normal that I forget almost everything my therapist said as soon as our session ends?
This happens to me every single time. I also feel like I lie to them and downplay my symptoms when I’m asked. I’ll say something and then I’ll be like “wait no that’s not true..” I only have one alter I know of who wants my world their way and if not, it call all fucking burn. Getting treatment is not on her agenda and she puts on this show for every doctor. I feel as if she takes a handle on the appointment and feeds the dr what she wants. I’ll even write stuff I NEED to say down so I can tell them but she switches in beforehand. I can’t tell that she has fronted right away, she’s an amazing mimic of me. She doesn’t read the note, she doesn’t tell them anything. Then she decides to switch out at her leisure, leaving me reeling and not remembering anything until the next session. Where I try to tell the dr.. and she won’t let me. Rinse and repeat.  She goes along with whatever pills they put us on, acts demure and simple and skates by under the fucking radar. She literally renders treatment useless at this moment.  
Is it normal that I forget almost everything my therapist said as soon as our session ends?
Is it that you totally forget even the gist of the conversation, the topics that were discussed and the general attitudes of both you and the t? Or is it closer to not being able to recall specific sentences, the way things were phrased, and other minutiae? I think if it's the second one, you're probably absorbing more than you realise.  
Is it normal that I forget almost everything my therapist said as soon as our session ends?
You can ask to he/her to record the session because you can't remember things they said or they will approach with a different way, better to your understanding and absorb  
Is it normal that I forget almost everything my therapist said as soon as our session ends?
Normal? Idk. But I know I do this sometimes. It used to be a constant thing but it’s much better for me. I think as I feel better my memory has improved. I still get anxious and depressed but I’m not constantly having severe mood disturbances anymore.  I’m sure your therapist knows you’re paying attention. She may be able to help you find a way to deal with it like taking a few minutes at the end of the session to recap the conversation.  
Is it normal that I forget almost everything my therapist said as soon as our session ends?
Yeah I’ve did sometimes feel this way in the beginning and it used to make me wonder if I was ever going to progress or learn anything... but turns out I was learning a lot, maybe on a subconscious level, or maybe just in a very slow gradual way. Because I’ve made so much progress In therapy.  But I’m sure your therapist won’t mind if you bring a journal and want to occasionally write down something they say that strikes you as something worth remembering.  
Is it normal that I forget almost everything my therapist said as soon as our session ends?
Yep, that can be dissociation or compartmentalizations. Totally normal for this to happen, especially after a heavy session. Take notes in session or right after session to help with this.

I understand that cutting people out of your life is necessary sometimes but why “no explanation”? I feel like everyone should get some kind of explanation if a friend of their’s just suddenly began ignoring them. Even if you think they deserve to be cut out, you should at least let them know, you don’t need to defend your point, simply letting them know that they aren’t serving a purpose in your life is good enough.

I agree. If I ever at one point was a toxic person or a dead end, I’d want to know, so I myself can come to terms with it and improve.

Some may react nasty, obsessive, and scary. But sometimes, the reaction isn’t the end result of their own mental health journey.  You might not be able to show them all their problems, but you can at least crack the door for them and give them the option to open it.

I agree to an extent, but this is more so for those that turn toxic and aren’t enhancing ones journey or path with their presence but killing everything on it, therefore I feel it is necessary to walk away without having to word vomit all of the ways they no longer serve a purpose in your life. Silently walking away is just as healthy as telling somebody you’re exiting stage left, especially if they’ve been belittling, toxic, unappreciative, and disloyal to you.

This. I think sometimes simply moving on without a word is the right thing to do, if nothing good would come of discussing it. Also, if reciprocation was never there. It might be completely fair to walk away without expending the effort to explain, if they never put that kind of effort into you.  This was my exact situation at one point, if you couldn't tell.

Thank you. It's hard to lose a friend who you simply outgrow. Hard to leave. Hard to know what to say or not to say as you leave. Hard to stay, when you know it's long since past the time to go.  But... I lost a friend a while back. He thought I was his best friend in the world. But he had long since ceased being my best friend. And frankly that was part of the outgrowing. That he couldn't see it. We hadn't just grown up. We hadn't just grown apart. I'd outgrown him. And I didnt want to judge him. Or hurt him. But... there was no part of my future that would be enhanced by his presence or participation.  And worst of all, he wouldn't let me go. The fights were awful. He had to know why. What had he done. Why did he deserve this.  If he could have understood my reasoning, he still wouldn't have accepted it. He may have deserved a reason. But... I'm not responsible to him for it. That's his shit.  So thank you for saying this.

jeeesus thank you for posting this today! :) this is a really important concept for people to get, i feel.  ​ i was one who definitely kept friendships and some unhealthy familial relationships going out of a sense of obligation or loyalty for time spent. It doesn't work in the longrun though, grating behaviour is grating behaviour and friends should ideally be a safe place to be 100% you. if you start having to hide important aspects of your self out of fear of jealousy, retribution, mockey or other - cut that dead end and walk. whether temporarily, with boundaries alone or permanently. it's your life!

That’s like... literally not what friends do.  You’re using this to explain shitty behavior.  Obviously there are lines, like when they become “toxic”, but if someone’s struggling and they “ no longer benefit you, you’re just an ass for leaving them.  Sorry

Of course no one owes anyone anything, and you're perfectly entitled to discard people as you want, but it doesn't make it the right thing to do, or a nice thing to do.  A simple explanation to someone who thinks of you as a friend is usually a decent thing to do for most people.

My therapist just told me he'd charge me the same amount if I move out 😭
Funny enough I'm in the same situation and my therapist offered to reduce my sessions by 25 dollars helping me save 100 on therapy if I find myself in hard times when I move out. 😭 I feel so indebted to him

It's so great how there's people out there who care enough about their job to literally jeopardize thousands of dollars just to make sure someone can get better. It gives me a much bigger appreciation for therapists. Best of luck to you on your journey!

I'm from France where social security system is better, but therapist are most of the time at least partly on your charge. Personnally, I have to pay 50%, which amount to 25€ per appointment. But my therapist basically lies to the government saying I come see her twice as often as I really do, which means it's eventually as if it were free.

My therapist is nice enough to give me a slogj discount. From $65 per session to $50 per session. Even the few times I've been late she excused me from the late fee. I do see her 4 times a month tho so seeing her is still my second largest bill other than rent. I do appreciate her so much tho . She's an independent licensed therapist who I was so so lucky to find.

I do see her 4 times a month tho so seeing her is still my second largest bill other than rent. I do appreciate her so much tho .

That's so great. I'd be seeing my therapist 8 times a month so it's great that he's not charging me as much. It means that I couldn't be able to pay rent for a room, but hey, living in my car shouldn't be so bad if that's what it needs to come to.  
My therapist just told me he'd charge me the same amount if I move out 😭
My previous therapist did the same thing when my insurance changed and he no longer took it, he fought with the billing department for a full month for me. Love him & miss him (I moved out of state)!! Thank god for therapists who put their patients first :)

I’m so glad for you. It sounds like it’s a great therapy relationship and it’s been helpful for you.  I wish therapists could do this more often.

Are you being abused by your parents, verbally or otherwise? There are many kinds of abuse (financial, emotional) that justify distancing yourself from the abuser. If not, and if you're living situation is OK, why would you move out at 19 years old, burdening yourself with the additional expense? Parents are expected to support their young adult children while they're in college and just starting out. I understand moving if your living situation is bad, but I think it's unwise to just up and move because your therapist thinks it's a good idea.
